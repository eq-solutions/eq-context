# OPS Tier — Pending

EQ items in `eq/pending.md`. SKS items in `sks/pending.md`. This file is
for operational support: tax, entities, infrastructure, substrate.

## Substrate Discipline

- [ ] **Calendar event registered** — recurring "Review eq-context rules/* for currency" on 28 April annually, first fires 2027-04-28. Owner: Royce. Outcome logged as session entry. **(Royce manual step.)**
- [ ] **Collapse sync-workflow duplicate state** — `.github/workflows/sync-context.yml` currently has two path lists that must stay in sync manually: the YAML `on.push.paths:` filter (decides workflow triggers) and the Python `SUBDIR_PATTERNS` glob (decides what files the script reads). Drift between them caused `sks-team/*` to silently never sync from 2026-05-04 to 2026-05-07. Worth either deriving one from the other, or adding a CI check that asserts they cover the same folders. Footgun documented in `system/lessons.md` 2026-05-07.
- [ ] **Edge-function checklist for substrate-structure changes** — when adding a new tier folder, the Supabase `context` edge function is on the checklist of things to update alongside the workflow. The 2026-05-04 tier refactor missed this and silently 404'd most tier-deep paths until 2026-05-07. Documented in `system/lessons.md` 2026-05-07. Could be hardened by adding a daily `/context/<random-slug>` smoke test or by parsing the edge function's behaviour against `context_files` rows.

## Cross-Tool Consistency — Original Reason for 2026-05-04 Refactor

The 2026-05-04 tier refactor solved tier-bleed and dead-product noise within Claude. It did NOT solve cross-tool consistency between Chat / Cowork / Code / ChatGPT / Grok. The substrate is now canonical for Claude only; ChatGPT and Grok still walk into every session blind. Three follow-up items, prioritised:

- [ ] **(A) ChatGPT and Grok bootstrap prompts** — produce `CHATGPT-PROMPT.md` and `GROK-PROMPT.md` mirroring `COWORK-PROMPT.md` (paste-once-per-session prompts that fetch the same canonical Supabase URLs). Highest-priority, lowest-risk follow-up. Closes the original framing: "consistency across all tools."
- [ ] **(C) `TODAY.md` — current-focus surface** — a 500-char file at repo root that captures the current week's priority and any blocked items. Auto-prepended to every session via the entry-point files. Cheap, high-signal, doesn't replace anything.
- [ ] **(B) Session-end discipline as a hard rule** — current rule says "update the substrate at session end"; lessons.md confirms the rule isn't being followed (17 of 30 stale at 2026-04-27). Revise to: every session ends with a written delta to a tier file (even "no changes today, status confirmed"), assistant refuses to close otherwise. Decision-grade change to non-negotiables.

Defer to: Beelink return (12 May+) for proper test coverage. Holiday-laptop work has higher risk of introducing new issues we can't test rigorously.

## Infrastructure — Live Blockers

- [ ] **OAuth GitHub MCP connector** — consent-screen auto-login loop blocks org-picker flow for `claude.ai` chat. Cowork writes are unblocked via PATs (2026-04-19); this item only gates the chat surface. Fix: revoke prior OAuth grant at `github.com/settings/applications`, sign out, reconnect from Claude desktop.
- [ ] **PAT rotation** — Milmlow + eq-solutions fine-grained PATs expire 2026-05-19. Calendar reminder set for 2026-05-16.
