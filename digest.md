## 🙋 Waiting on you (274)

_Items only you can clear — a confirm, a click-through, or a call. Not engineering backlog; the Pending sections below exclude these._

- **eq-shell** · **Not click-tested live** — Quotes is auth-gated and this environment had no Shell session/credentials; separately, entering credentials directly is off-limits regardless. Worth a real pass once confirmed live: search for a quote outside the default "In Progress" tab (e.g. a draft) and confirm it now surfaces in both list and board layouts, with the new notice showing. _(added 2026-09-03)_
- **eq-shell** · **Not click-tested live** — no Shell session/credentials in this environment. Worth a real pass: upload a new version of a document that already has real signers, confirm the version number bumps, the old signers show as needing to re-sign, "Push to the same N people" actually re-creates outstanding rows for them (and is a no-op, not a duplicate, if clicked/retried), and Version history lists every version with its own signed/outstanding count including one nobody's been pushed to yet. _(added 2026-09-03)_
- **eq-shell** · **Not click-tested live** — confirming the fix needs a live PostHog project plus a real session left open past two 5-minute poll ticks, watching PostHog's own activity feed for exactly one `$create_alias` instead of one per tick. _(added 2026-09-02)_
- **eq-shell** · **Not click-tested live** — verified via `pnpm exec tsc -b --force` and `eslint` (both clean) plus an independent merge-readiness audit before merging. This machine's Node 24 breaks `vite build`/`netlify dev` for this repo (pre-existing, unrelated to this change), so no live click-through was possible. Worth a real pass: KPI numbers match the table's own counts, per-team rows sum to the roster totals, mobile view unchanged. _(added 2026-09-02)_
- **eq-shell** · **Not click-tested live** — verified via `tsc -b --force` + `eslint` only (both clean). Reproducing the actual pending-approval message needs a real Cards signup mid-approval-queue, not something drivable from this environment. _(added 2026-09-01)_
- **eq-shell** · **Not click-tested live by a person** — verified via `tsc -b --force`, `eslint`, and by actually rendering sample PDFs from the code with mock data (4 variants: with/without logo, all-signed, small site-set) and visually inspecting them — not a live authenticated download. Worth a real pass: open the Register tab for a tenant with an uploaded document logo, pull a multi-site certificate, confirm logo/title/pill render as expected in a real download. _(added 2026-09-01)_
- **eq-shell** · **Not click-tested live** — no Shell/Cards session available in this environment. Worth a real pass: hit `/join?tenant=<slug>` 6× rapidly with the same phone and confirm the 6th returns 429 with `Retry-After`, then confirm a genuine join still succeeds after the window (or immediately for a different phone). _(added 2026-09-01)_
- **eq-shell** · **Not click-tested live** — no Shell session/credentials in this environment. Worth a real pass: open `/admin/users`, switch to Pending, confirm it renders real outstanding invites for a tenant that has some. _(added 2026-09-01)_
- **eq-shell** · **Not click-tested live** — PR #1708's own test plan flags this: build/tests/lint clean, but nobody's archived a real staff-linked account and watched the new checkbox clear it. _(added 2026-09-01)_
- **eq-shell** · **Not click-tested live** — no Shell session/credentials in this environment, and Vite/`netlify dev` are unreliable under this machine's Node 24 (existing memory), so no attempt was made to fake it. Worth a real pass: open a customer with a Field-enabled site and confirm the pill now shows on; toggle the pill off and confirm every owned site follows; check a customer with zero sites shows the toggle disabled with the right tooltip; same 3 checks on the separate App activation admin page. _(added 2026-09-01)_
- **eq-shell** · **Not click-tested live** — no Shell session/credentials in this environment; verified via `tsc -b --force`, `eslint`, and a merge-readiness audit that reproduced the CI run end-to-end. Worth a real pass: open a quote for a customer with existing sites, click "Link existing site," confirm it searches every site in the tenant and auto-fills onto the quote once linked; try "New site" with a name close to an existing one and confirm the duplicate warning shows.
- **eq-shell** · **3 directories left on disk, OS-locked, not deletable from this session** — `git worktree remove` unregistered them from git (2 errored "Result too large" but still unregistered; 1 confirmed via `git worktree prune`), but the physical folders survived both `Remove-Item -Force` and `rm -rf` ~10 minutes apart, both failing with "device or resource busy" / "being used by another process." Locking process not identified (`Get-CimInstance Win32_Process` showed nothing obviously relevant). Needs Royce to close whatever has them open (or a reboot) before they're actually reclaimable: `.claude\worktrees\contact-auto-site-ops-download-325f25`, `.claude\worktrees\list-user-invites-existing-user-filter`, `.claude\worktrees\simplified-interface-users-764a0d`. _(added 2026-09-01)_

## Pending (SKS)

- **Affects 45 of 81 active SKS staff** (everyone Cards-linked with no wizard-entered full date of birth) — fixed going forward, but nobody's birthday has actually been re-entered yet. No action needed unless Royce wants a nudge to re-save. Most should self-resolve as people go through Cards' own licence-scan step, which fills a real date of birth in automatically. _(added 2026-08-24)_
- **Aiden's own birthday (18 Feb) was tested then reverted to blank** — unclear if that's his real date or just what was typed while reproducing the bug; needs a real re-save to confirm either way. Separately, his record still carries the *earlier* session's own trial data (job title, emergency contact, start date) that was meant to be trial-then-undo and never was — untouched by this session, still open. _(added 2026-08-24)_
- **A second, unidentified path also creates blank-name logins** — proven by timing, not guessed: Todd Wilson's and David Boyd's shell logins were created 7 weeks *after* their Cards approval, which rules out the path just patched as their cause. Spawned as background task `task_d904d388`, Royce started it in a separate session; running independently, not yet reported back as of this session's close. _(added 2026-08-23)_
- **Not verified live by a person** — the specific pill-click behavior needs a real Core+SKS session to exercise (Teams is SKS-only, gated behind Core auth, not reachable from a standalone deploy-preview session). Confirmed the fix mirrors an already-shipped, working code pattern (the crew-supervisor picker), not watched working fresh. _(added 2026-08-23)_
- **SKS's own number, for reference: 6 of 32 active SKS members are currently missing White Card** — visible today in Shell's Training Matrix; nothing blocks them from working while missing it (soft-flag by design, not an oversight). Worth a look if Royce wants a harder rule for SKS specifically. _(added 2026-08-19)_
- **A reported roster-grid "alignment" issue (one person's row looked off) couldn't be reproduced from the code** — most likely just placeholder text in blank cells reading like real data at a glance, not an actual bug, but left open rather than guessed at. _(added 2026-08-19)_
- **Still not applied to the live database — checked directly, and Royce turned down the shortcut that would have unblocked it today.** Confirmed merging the PR didn't secretly switch it on. Turning it on for real right now would lock the people who haven't signed in yet out of their own timesheet and leave the moment they do, since the fix depends on their login already being linked to their staff record — 37 of 83 active SKS staff, checked again today. A workaround exists (let just those specific people keep today's wider access until they sign in, instead of holding up everyone else) but Royce said no — waiting for them to actually sign in through the real onboarding process instead, however long that takes. _(added 2026-08-16, decision confirmed 2026-08-16)_
- **The disposable EQ-side tenant doesn't have this fix** — lower priority, since that tenant holds no real data, but the identical gap exists there too and needs some prerequisite pieces built first before it can be ported. _(added 2026-08-16)_
- **Run the first real weekly export/import test** — SKS NSW Labour → Export Schedule CSV → EQ Field (logged in as the SKS org) → Import Schedule CSV. Discussed and confirmed safe; not actually run this session. _(added 2026-08-14)_
- **~7 SKS staff missing from EQ Field's staff table** (hired since the 5 Jul snapshot): Ahmed Masaud, Amir Farid, Callum Treharne, Jhon Jairo Velasquez Meneses, ~~Nabeel Hussain~~, Paul Bolger, Timothy Sue — plus a handful of name-string mismatches (e.g. "Bruno Pedrosa" vs "Bruno Vita Pedrosa", "Jose Quintanilla" vs "Jose Luis Quintanilla Rodriguez"). Royce said he'll manage this himself via EQ Field's People admin. **Correction 2026-08-25: "Nabeel Hussain" was never missing** — he's already in `app_data.staff`, just filed under his legal first name "Mohammed Hussain" (confirmed via matching personal email `nabzhussain95@…` and phone). Likely a name-string-match false positive against whatever hire list this cross-check ran against — same class of gap as the "Bruno Pedrosa" mismatch example earlier in this same bullet. Not investigated further (fixing the matching heuristic wasn't this session's scope); the other 6 names + mismatches remain unverified. _(added 2026-08-14, corrected 2026-08-25)_

## Queue health

_Hygiene signal, not an alert — a large open count is real backlog; a large done count is unrotated history that belongs in a changelog; a large aging count is open work that's gone 45+ days quiet under its dated section and is worth a look before it becomes the next 478-item surprise. Open splits engineering backlog from Royce's own queue (a confirm, a click-through, a call) — the two used to be counted together here, which made the number look worse than the real engineering backlog actually is; the split matches 'Waiting on you' above._

## Aging open items (45d+, unconfirmed)

_Open items sitting under a section header this old or older — not necessarily wrong, just gone quiet under its own dated write-up. Worth a look before it reads as done-and-forgotten._

- **eq-shell** (2026-07-19) · **Still open, not urgent:** the exact reason EQ Field was slow to load for that one person on 2026-07-19 is unconfirmed — likely just a poor connection, but couldn't fully rule out anything worse. Nothing else has reported it since. _(added 2026-07-19)_
- **eq-shell** (2026-07-17) · **Deferred: who should get the weekly summary email?** Built and ready, just needs a recipient list from Royce before it's switched on. _(added 2026-07-17)_
- **eq-shell** (2026-07-17) · **Declined for now (Royce's call): a personal calendar feed per crew member, and a weather warning near Microsoft dock dates.** Offered as options alongside the above; not built. _(added 2026-07-17)_
- **eq-shell** (2026-07-16) · **Deferred: bigger first-load speedup** — breaking one large file into smaller pieces that only load when needed. Real win, but a bigger change that needs a hands-on check, not just automated tests. _(added 2026-07-19)_
- **eq-shell** (2026-07-16) · **Deferred: extend the "you'll lose this" warning** to other forms — site details, invites, admin settings. Currently only on quotes. _(added 2026-07-19)_
- **eq-shell** (2026-07-16) · **Deferred: make long lists load a page at a time** instead of everything at once (quotes, comms roster, staff, customers). _(added 2026-07-19)_
- **eq-shell** (2026-07-16) · **Now in scope, not yet built: extend the "you'll lose this" warning to more forms** (site details, invites, admin settings — currently only quotes), a plain "you're offline" banner when the connection drops, and re-checking sign-in status automatically when someone comes back to a tab left open a while. _(added 2026-07-19)_
- **eq-shell** (2026-07-17) · **Royce to eyeball the live dashboard signed in** — the endpoint/bundle/error-monitoring checks are all clean, but only a signed-in pass confirms the three bands render correctly and the rostered-but-lapsed join surfaces real people. _(added 2026-07-17)_
- **eq-shell** (2026-07-17) · **Gate keys are interim** (`field.view`/`service.view`) — swap to the cluster-1 granular keys (`field.view_licences` etc., PR #885, concurrent session) once that ships. _(added 2026-07-17)_
- **eq-shell** (2026-07-17) · **Phase 2 deferred: crew-demand overlay.** Needs a `crew_required` column added to `app_data.jobs` (One Pipe migration, both planes) so the "can we staff what we've won" verdict has a real demand side — supply side (deployable crew) is live now, demand isn't wired yet. _(added 2026-07-16)_
- **eq-shell** (2026-07-17) · **Phase 3 deferred: the one commercial signal permitted by the scope decision** — "N quotes won but no job number yet," gated behind `quotes.view`, no dollar amount, off the default board. Not built. _(added 2026-07-16)_
- **eq-shell** (2026-07-17) · **Eyeball the next SKS morning brief once signed in** to confirm the signals render as expected end-to-end. The query logic is verified against live data and the deploy is smoke-verified, but the authed brief output itself needs a signed-in SKS session (10-minute per-user cache, or wait for the daily scheduled email). _(added 2026-07-17)_
- **eq-shell** (2026-07-14) · **Later audit polish** — PDF / branded-report export, and logging who reads the log; then on-request data erasure and anomaly alerts. _(added 2026-07-14; before/after values shipped in #860)_
- **eq-shell** (2026-07-14) · **Crew retry + Sentry watch** — have the crew reopen via a normal browser tab (their home-screen icon may hold stale code from the day's deploys); if anyone still freezes, the fix now self-tags the exact stall in Sentry (`verify-timeout` / `login-timeout` / `session-spinner-timeout` / `chunk-error`). _(added 2026-07-14)_
- **eq-shell** (2026-07-14) · **Material-preset sanity check** — since materials presets now quote at Rate + markup, any entered as already-marked-up sell prices will read higher; worth a glance in the Rate library. _(added 2026-07-14, carried from #820)_
_…and 274 more — see each file's Queue health row above._

## Possible recurring failures (unconfirmed)

_Session logs mention a pattern matching a known failure below, dated after its last recorded occurrence. Not yet counted — if it's real, bump `recurrences` in [failures.md](system/failures.md) and `guard-ratchet.yml` proposes promotion on its own next run._
