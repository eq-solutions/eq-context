# Changelog — EQ Solves Field

## [2026-04-27] Multi-tenancy + dev-workflow plan locked (planning only, no code shipped)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code (Opus 4.7)
**Changes:**
- Living plan document captured at
  `eq-solves-field/.claude/worktrees/hopeful-wright-058c8b/MULTI-TENANCY-PLAN.md`.
- Three strategic decisions locked:
  - Sprint scope = Phase 1 only (PostHog flags + project-hours feature + 5-tier
    role system). Phase 2 deferred to first self-serve trial signup OR ~3
    customers manually provisioned.
  - Tenancy lives inside `ktmjmdzqrogauaevbktn` only; SKS Labour
    (`nspbmirochztcjijmcrx`) untouched.
  - Auth: Supabase-native JWT minted in `verify-pin.js` with
    `app_metadata.tenant_id` and `app_metadata.eq_role`; PIN UX preserved.
- Tenant URL convention locked: `eq.solutions/field/<slug>/`. Path-based slug
  resolution, single shared Netlify site, no subdomains.
- 5-tier role system designed (`manager > supervisor > employee > apprentice >
  labour_hire`) with `eq_role` Postgres enum and `people.role` column.
- Single PIN per tenant on `organisations.tenant_pin`; per-role PIN env var
  pattern dropped.
- Permission matrix HTML built at
  `eq-context/drafts/eq-field-roles-2026-04-27/permission-matrix.html` plus v1
  JSON snapshot at `permissions-by-role-v1.json` (manager 56 / supervisor 36 /
  employee 13 / apprentice 17 / labour_hire 5).
- First PostHog flag designed: `feat_project_hours_v1` gates new project-hours
  burn-down feature with `sites.track_hours` + `sites.budget_hours`.

**Status:** Plan complete. No code touched. Phase 1 implementation pending
explicit Royce go-ahead.
