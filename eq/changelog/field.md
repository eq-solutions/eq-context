# Changelog — EQ Solves Field

## [2026-07-21] Site Reports hub nav button removed (MERGED, #519, v3.5.345, live)
- Follow-up to the same-day Safety nav flatten below: with Prestarts/Toolboxes now living directly in the Safety group, the separate "Site Reports" hub tile (`nav-site-reports`) was redundant. Removed from the sidebar.
- Diary was the hub's third tile and has no other nav entry point — left unreachable **by explicit decision** (Royce declined adding it a dedicated button), not an oversight. `page-diary`/`diary.js` and `page-site-reports`/`site-reports-hub.js` are untouched, just unlinked.
- Fixed a stale code comment near the Safety Records "Open ↗" button that still described "the Site Reports hub" as the access path for `site-reports.js`/`toolbox.js` — it's the Safety group's own Prestarts/Toolboxes buttons now.
- Originally tagged v3.5.343; renumbered to v3.5.345 during a same-day rebase after PR #522 (below) claimed v3.5.344 first. PR #519, squash-merged `b60a2a4` → `main`, confirmed live via `sw.js` banner + a clean deploy-preview boot (zero console errors, EQ-tenant dashboard rendered) before merge.

## [2026-07-21] Deferred 30 of 31 head scripts to fix a real slow-cold-open bug (MERGED, #522, v3.5.344, live)
- Royce reported the app feels slow on first load and asked what could be done. Measured rather than guessed: ~5.4s to `domInteractive` / ~6.2s to `window.load` on a cold hit, despite only ~230KB of total script+CSS transfer — not a bandwidth problem. Root cause: all 31 core `<head>` scripts were plain synchronous `<script src>` tags; HTTP/2 already fetches them in parallel, but the parser still had to execute them one at a time, in document order, before continuing.
- Added `defer` to 30 of the 31. Audited every file first for top-level (script-load-time, not function-call-time) reads of another file's globals — only one real cross-file dependency exists (`supabase.js`'s `_restoreWriteQueue()` IIFE reading `_EQ_QUEUE_CRYPTO` from `supabase-queue-crypto.js`), and `defer` preserves relative execution order, so it still holds.
- `app-state.js` deliberately kept synchronous — its `earlyBootBranding()` IIFE is a zero-flash-of-unbranded-content technique that must run before the body paints; deferring it would push that stamp to right before `DOMContentLoaded` (after the whole body has parsed/painted), defeating the point. One small (~16KB) synchronous script is a fair trade for keeping that intact.
- Found and fixed one real breakage the audit surfaced: the sidebar version-badge painter read `APP_VERSION` synchronously with no ready-state guard — safe before only because `app-state.js` was synchronous and had already run by then. Now wrapped in a `DOMContentLoaded` listener. Main boot sequence (`loadTenantConfig`/`checkAccess`/`initApp`) was already gated on `window.onload`, unaffected either way.
- Verified before merge: full test suite green (514 assertions) + a local `netlify dev` boot with zero console errors + a live deploy-preview smoke test with real tenant config — `domInteractive` ~2.0s (down from ~5.4s), branding classes/tier attribute/version badge all correct, zero errors. PR #522, squash-merged `7fd3be7` → `main`, confirmed live via `sw.js` banner on `field.eq.solutions`.

## [2026-07-21] Safety nav flattened into one collapsible group, per Royce's own screenshot (MERGED, #517, v3.5.341/342, live)
- Follow-up to the same-day duplicate-Prestart-form fix (#516, below): un-hiding `nav-site-reports` for SKS in that PR left it visible for the first time, sitting in a nonsensical spot inherited from years of being invisible. Royce asked why, then sent a screenshot of the live SKS sidebar with an exact spec: one collapsible "Safety" group containing Prestarts, Toolboxes, Site Audits, Records, Report, and Test Equipment as direct sidebar items — no separate hub, no in-page tab switcher.
- `nav-prestart`/`nav-toolbox` turned out to already be fully wired to real, working pages (`page-prestart`/`page-toolbox`) — just sitting hidden in an old "Testing" nav section since before Site Reports existed, with no code anywhere ever making them visible. Moved into the Safety group and relabelled "Prestarts"/"Toolboxes".
- Site Audits and Records were previously two tabs inside one "Safety" page. Split into two direct sidebar buttons that stash the target tab in `window._safetyPendingTab` and call `showPage('safety')` — reusing the exact deferred-tab handoff `loadSafety()` already used internally, so zero changes needed in `safety.js`. The now-redundant in-page tab row was hidden.
- v3.5.341 (reposition only) shipped first; v3.5.342 (full flatten, Royce's screenshot spec) landed in the same PR before merge. PR #517, squash-merged `7dbc88e` → `main`, confirmed live via `sw.js` banner.

## [2026-07-21] Tenant-isolation root fix — bind tenant at session-mint time, not on client trust (MERGED, #521, live)
- Follow-up to #509's detect-only telemetry, built ahead of schedule. `verify-pin.js` mints the Field session token via 4 paths (plain PIN, Shell-cookie SSO, legacy HMAC shell-token, Supabase-JWT shell-token); 3 never bound `tenant_slug` into the signed token, so every later `canon-read.js`/`mint-data-jwt` call fell back to a client-supplied tenant hint, bounded only by a static allow-list.
- Fixed all 4: plain PIN binds from the request Origin header (the only server-trusted signal available — no Shell context exists at this point); Shell-cookie resolves from the HMAC-verified cookie's own `tenant_id` claim; legacy HMAC shell-token (retired, no live caller) now passes through its own already-Shell-signed claim instead of dropping it.
- **Found a more serious issue while building the 4th, live path**: the Shell→Field Supabase-JWT handoff was binding tenant from the client-supplied `body.tenantSlug` hint rather than the JWT's own signed `app_metadata.tenant_id` claim — a valid Shell JWT minted for tenant A plus a spoofed hint in the POST body could mint a Field session (and downstream data-JWT) bound to tenant B. Fixed so the JWT's own claim always wins; the hint is now only a fallback for the should-not-happen case where the claim doesn't map to a known tenant. Logs a Sentry warning (non-blocking) if hint and claim ever disagree, as a canary.
- New regression test `tests/tenant-binding.test.js` (11 assertions) locks in all 4 paths, including the escalation case. Full suite + eslint clean.
- PR #521, squash-merged `021b42c` → `main`, confirmed live via Netlify deploy `commit_ref` match (`context: production`) + smoke test.

## [2026-07-20] Detect-only tenant-fallback telemetry for the golden-worker-journey identity/tenant-isolation gap (MERGED, #509, live)
- Found while tracing the full worker journey (Shell → Cards → Field): `canon-read.js` and `verify-pin.js`'s `mint-data-jwt` both fall back to a client-supplied tenant slug when the caller's session carries no `tenant_slug` claim — true of every plain-PIN Field login. That fallback is bounded only by a fixed allow-list, which stops hostname/injection abuse but not a session for one tenant requesting another tenant's worker PII.
- Shipped detect-only: a non-blocking Sentry warning fires whenever the fallback is taken, tagged with the Origin-derived tenant for comparison, with zero behaviour change — real usage data first, enforcement decision second. One-time scheduled check `collision-alert-week1-check` set for 2026-07-27 to read the real frequency/mismatch ratio back.
- PR #509, squash-merged `30f44d4` → `main`, confirmed live via Netlify deploy `commit_ref` match. (A separate same-day follow-up session found and fixed a real delivery bug in this telemetry — un-awaited Sentry calls dropped on Lambda freeze — as PR #515; see that entry/session log, not duplicated here.)

## [2026-07-21] safety.js's duplicate Prestart + Toolbox forms retired (MERGED, #516, v3.5.340, live)
- Found that `safety.js` and `site-reports.js` both declared 8 identically-named global functions for Prestart (`loadPrestarts`, `renderPrestart`, `_prestartRow`, `openPrestartForm`, `renderPrestartForm`, `canSubmitPrestart`, `savePrestartDraft`, `submitPrestart`). A v3.5.265 changelog entry confirms Prestart was intentionally moved from `safety.js` into `site-reports.js`, but the old copy under the Safety tab was never removed — whichever script loaded most recently silently won for both, including which submit-gate rule ran (`safety.js`'s version never required a works-scope entry before submit; `site-reports.js`'s does).
- Removed `safety.js`'s own Prestart create/edit form, submit gate, and list view (~660 lines). Kept everything Records/Site-Audits/Toolbox still read: `_prestartCache` (loader renamed `loadPrestarts` → `_loadPrestartRecords`, off the collision name), `_psExportDocx` (Records tab's Word export), and Toolbox's "import from prestart" lookup. Two helpers misnamed with a `_ps` prefix despite being shared with Toolbox were renamed to `_siteFieldFocus`/`_siteFieldBlur`.
- Truth-check pass before opening the PR caught two real bugs the first pass missed: a dead `_sigSave()` auto-submit branch that referenced the just-deleted `_prestartDraft`/`canSubmitPrestart` unconditionally (would have thrown on every signature save, including Toolbox's), and Toolbox's own site-field input silently reusing the deleted `_psSiteFocus`/`_psSiteBlur`. Also caught a CI-only ESLint `no-undef` error a local test run didn't surface.
- **v3.5.340 follow-up in the same PR, before it was ever merged, found the identical bug in Toolbox Talks**: `safety.js` and `toolbox.js` shared 9 colliding globals (including `loadToolboxTalks` itself). Checked live first — `toolbox_talks` has 0 rows ever on SKS's own `ehow` database, vs `prestarts`' 34 — fixed the same way regardless, for consistency.
- **Two real bugs in the first (Prestart-only) version of this fix, caught before it ever reached production:**
  1. It removed Safety's Prestart tab on the wrong assumption that `site-reports.js`'s copy (under the Site Reports hub) was reachable as a fallback for SKS. It wasn't — `nav-site-reports` had been hidden for the SKS tenant since v3.5.91, back when Site Reports was assumed EQ-only. Verified live on `ehow` before touching anything: `prestarts` has 34 rows, used daily. As built, the fix would have removed SKS's only working path to a form they use every day. Fixed by un-hiding `nav-site-reports` for SKS (`app-state.js`) and adding `site-reports.js`/`toolbox.js` as load dependencies of the `'safety'` lazy-load bucket (`lazy-loader.js`) — the Records tab's "Open ↗" button calls `openPrestartForm`/`openToolboxForm` directly and needs them loaded regardless of visit order.
  2. It deleted `#modal-prestart` from `index.html`, believing it was `safety.js`'s own private modal. It wasn't — there was only ever one `#modal-prestart`/`#prestart-form-body` pair in the whole file, shared by both JS implementations via plain `getElementById` calls. Deleting it would have broken `site-reports.js`'s real, surviving Prestart form, not just the duplicate. Restored it, kept `#modal-toolbox` the same way this time, and restored the SKS-only mobile-fullscreen CSS (`_injectSafetyStyle`, v3.5.247) riding on the same injection — `safety.js` is the only thing that ever injected it, since it never loads for EQ.
- v3.5.340, PR #516, all 11 existing test suites pass (514 assertions), CI green, deploy preview green, eslint 0 errors. Merged (squash `3a3db42`), confirmed live via `sw.js` banner on `field.eq.solutions`. **A real SKS click-through was attempted but not completed** — see the pending.md entry for why (safety guards correctly blocked moving the SKS DB key through local tooling) — worth Royce independently confirming live.

## [2026-07-21] Extracted + tested core logic from the app's 3 largest untested files (SHIPPED, #510/#511/#512, live)
- `timesheets.js` (hours/completion rules, fixed a red/green display drift bug along the way), `apprentices.js` (year-advancement eligibility + rating aggregation), `roster.js` (the approved-leave overlay mechanism — the same subsystem behind the 2026-07-11 "leave shows 0" incident) each had their highest-risk pure logic extracted into small, dependency-injected, headless-testable modules (`*-rules.js`), following the pattern already proven safe: zero behavior change, thin wrapper call sites, golden-file tests.
- Also reviewed `approve-leave.js`'s security surface (flagged unverified across 3 prior multi-lens reviews) — no issue found.
- Follow-up PR (#513) corrected wording in the apprentices extraction: year-advancement and rating comments had drifted into "compliance/licensing" framing, which is the wrong lens per the app's human-recognition charter — corrected to describe trade-progression and growth-visibility instead. Comment-only, no behavior change.
- v3.5.335–337 + #513, all merged to main, all existing tests green throughout.

## [2026-07-21] Mobile My Schedule + home tile now show Saturday/Sunday when rostered (SHIPPED, #514, live)
- My Schedule day cards (`roster.js` `renderSchedule`) and the home tile (shift count / next-shift / schedule subtitle in `home.js`) were hardcoded to Mon–Fri, silently dropping any Sat/Sun shift even though `schedule.sat`/`schedule.sun` and the desktop roster grid already carry that data. Both now build their day list from the existing `getVisibleRosterDays()` helper — the same "only show Sat/Sun if the week actually has weekend work" rule the desktop grid already uses.
- `home.js`'s usage is `typeof`-guarded (falls back to Mon–Fri) since `roster.js` is lazy-loaded in this app and may not be loaded yet when the home tile renders at boot — matches the existing `isLeave`/`isEducation` guard pattern already in the file.
- v3.5.338, PR #514, squash-merged to main. Display-logic only, no schema/data change. Sibling fix shipped same day to sks-nsw-labour (v3.10.99, PR #68). Built in a fresh worktree (`eq-field-mobile-weekend-wt`) since the root checkout was mid-unrelated telemetry work.

## [2026-07-21] Fix Sentry telemetry delivery: await captureServerError, correct tag shape (SHIPPED, #515, live)
- PR #509's detect-only fallback telemetry (merged 2026-07-20 as `30f44d4`) had been silently not reporting: the eq-field Sentry project showed zero `netlify_function`-tagged events in 90 days. Two independent bugs, both fixed.
- Bug 1: both new call sites (`canon-read.js`, `verify-pin.js`) invoked `captureServerError()` without `await` — the in-flight Sentry POST gets dropped when the Lambda freezes on return. Proved locally against a stub ingest listener before trusting the fix: un-awaited delivered 0 events at return time, awaited delivered before returning.
- Bug 2: three pre-existing error-path sites (`eq-agent.js`, `send-email.js`, `tenant-config.js`) passed `{ function }` / `{ fn }` instead of `{ tags: { netlify_function } }` — `_buildEvent` only reads `opts.tags`, so those keys were silently discarded and those sites never set the tag at all.
- All 5 sites fixed. Squash-merged `cd39bc2`; production deploy confirmed (`6a5eec6e`, 15s, secret-scan clean, all 5 functions rebuilt with fresh timestamps). Post-deploy Sentry re-check: still zero events, expected — the fallback path needs a specific real-world request shape (session missing `tenant_slug` + client tenant hint) that a deploy alone doesn't generate. Follow-up: re-check after real traffic to read the `origin_mismatch` ratio.
- Hit the known squash-merge stranded-SHA trap mid-session (branch's older commit was already merged as part of #509) — resolved via `git rebase --onto` rather than a raw conflict-merge, backed by a throwaway branch first.

## [2026-07-21] v3.5.334 — decompose supabase.js, 2278 → 1010 lines (SHIPPED, #508, live)
- Wed-Thu sprint centerpiece (see the multi-lens audit entry below). `supabase.js` was the fastest-growing file in the app (+34% in 5 weeks per the audit) and the single most load-bearing file for both live tenants — every write in the app routes through it — with zero test coverage until the day before.
- Split into 6 new files, each moved verbatim (no logic change), verified against the full test suite (386 assertions, 8 files) after every single extraction: `supabase-queue-crypto.js` (write-queue encryption), `roster-undo.js` (undo/redo), `supabase-rpc.js` (RPC helpers), `supabase-canon-write.js` (canonical timesheets/roster write dispatch), `supabase-roster-write.js` (the roster cell-save hot path — kept separate given its complexity), `supabase-entities.js` (per-table CRUD helpers).
- `sbFetch` itself — the core routing function — deliberately NOT split; highest-risk, most tightly-coupled piece, needs its own dedicated pass. Flagged as a follow-up.
- Also fixed a real bug the new tests found the day before: a write that kept failing due to server/network issues was supposed to give up after 5 retries and instead retried forever (the retry-counter only worked for one narrower failure mode). Fixed properly, same day, verified via the same test flipping from "confirms bug" to "confirms fix."
- Live-verified via deploy-preview browser smoke test (not just Node tests): all 6 new files load with zero console errors, and the actual cross-file call chain works correctly end-to-end.

## [2026-07-20/21] Multi-lens strategic audit (4th run) + the week's sprint it produced (SHIPPED, #505 + #506 + #507 + #508, live)
- 4th in a recurring CEO/UI/engineering-quality review series (prior: 2026-05-13, 2026-05-23, 2026-06-14). Findings: strongest security cycle of the four (server-side permission enforcement, a generalized "Core-only" auth switch); automated tests exist for the first time (0→7 files, now 8 after this sprint); a real mobile-usability program landed. Recurring problem: a handful of files keep growing past a healthy size, worse for the 3rd review running, no rule stopping it. Also flagged: the Melbourne enterprise-customer plan appears to have gone quiet (needs Royce's confirmation), and found 4 already-stale to-do items that had actually shipped months ago but were still listed open.
- Sprint executed same session: a file-size convention adopted; a cosmetic bug the audit's own live-check found (login screen said "for SKS" even for the `eq` tenant) fixed; `approve-leave.js`'s security model documented (no gap found, one UX trade-off flagged for Royce); automated tests written for `supabase.js` (see the entry above); then the decomposition itself.
- Full review: `_reviews/multi-lens/2026-07-20.md`.

## [2026-07-20] v3.5.333 — Core-only gate copy: drop the last hardcoded 'sks' checks (SHIPPED, #506 + #461, live)
- PR #461 (open since 2026-07-12, closing the `eq` tenant's standalone demo-login gate) had gone stale: main had since shipped a general "Core-only" kill-switch that already covered most of what #461's diff did, via a hardcoded check that would have conflicted with it. Rewrote to close the one real gap the general switch didn't cover (a supervisor-password backdoor), merged, and flipped the canonical flag that actually activates the lock for `eq`. Live-verified: `eq` now requires signing in through Core, matching SKS.
- Found smoke-testing that fix live: the same hardcoded-slug pattern was still present in one more spot (the standalone "My Timesheet" login) and in the gate's own copy text. Fixed both same day.
- Bundled with 3 other sprint items: a file-size convention added to the repo's own contributor guide; a stale to-do item (`pending_schedule` table) confirmed already resolved by earlier work, not a live decision; `approve-leave.js`'s security model documented.

## [2026-07-19] Test-only: CI guard on the routing bypass that hid the 6-view grant gap (SHIPPED, #500, live)
- New `tests/canonical-routing-guard.test.js` asserts `sks` stays in `ROSTER_CANONICAL_TENANTS`/`TIMESHEETS_CANONICAL_TENANTS`/`LEAVE_CANONICAL_TENANTS` and that `prestarts`/`toolbox_talks`/`site_diaries` stay in `JWT_INPLACE_TABLES` — the two routing layers that keep the #498 grant gap (below) from ever mattering in practice. If either is ever edited away, CI now fails loud instead of prod silently 403ing for SKS again.
- No production code touched, no schema/migration change, no deploy risk.

## [2026-07-19] DB-only: restored `authenticated` grant on 6 app_data.field_* views on live ehow (SHIPPED, #498, live)
- `field_schedule`/`field_timesheets`/`field_leave_requests`/`field_prestarts`/`field_toolbox_talks`/`field_site_diaries` had all silently lost their `authenticated` grant at some point after the `20260611_sks_canonical_field_sync.sql` migration created them with it present — likely a later `DROP`+recreate against the normalized tables that didn't carry the grants forward.
- Investigated and confirmed **not currently live-breaking for SKS**: a later "Design B" canonical-adapter layer already routes real roster/timesheets/leave traffic around these exact views to base tables that do carry the grant (built independently, for a different reason, after the same failure class hit twice before per the adapters' own code comments). Still a primed landmine if that routing config ever changes, so fixed anyway — no app code/version bump, DB grants only.
- Applied live to ehow via Supabase MCP on Royce's explicit go; repo record merged as PR #498.

## [2026-07-19] Access-model cluster 3 — eq-field write-splits enforced end to end (SHIPPED, PRs #496/#497/#499, live)
- Enforces the `field.manage_roster` / `field.manage_licences` / `field.manage_labour_hire` keys (shipped in `@eq-solutions/roles` v2.5.3, mirrored into Shell's Access Control page but previously enforced nowhere). All three default to manager+supervisor, so every PR here is a no-op for current users until a tenant customises Access Control — the value is making the toggles actually enforceable.
- **#496 (client gating, live).** Verified first that licence-management and labour-hire-company aren't separate Field features — both are two text fields inside the shared Person modal — and scoped accordingly: a full permission gate on the real roster/teams write surface (`roster.js`/`teams.js`, also closing a pre-existing gap where 3 team-write functions had no guard of their own, only their modal opener did) + field-level disable on the two Person-modal inputs. The permission helper was centralised in the eager-loaded `permissions.js` after a first draft in `roster.js` threw `ReferenceError` on the standalone `teams` lazy page (loads `teams.js` without `roster.js`).
- **#497 (server enforcement, live).** RLS policy hardening on `schedule_entries` (roster) + permission checks inside the 3 `SECURITY DEFINER` trigger functions (`field_teams_iud`/`field_team_members_iud`/`field_people_iud`, since SECURITY DEFINER bypasses base-table RLS). Validation caught a real trap: the Supabase-MCP connection runs as `postgres` (`rolbypassrls=true`), so a naive RLS test false-passes — fixed by testing under `SET LOCAL ROLE authenticated`.
- **#499 (follow-up, live).** `field_people_iud`'s `field.manage_labour_hire` guard reverted only `NEW.agency` on an unauthorised edit, never `NEW.hire_company` — a second `app_data.staff` column any authenticated session, any role, could set via a direct API call. Fixed with the same revert pattern; verified live with a forced-rollback tamper test (employee → both columns revert; supervisor → legitimate change applies). A stale note claiming this was already fixed was checked against live and corrected.
- Sibling eq-solves-service work shipped as PR #551 (see the Service changelog).

## [2026-07-15] Pipeline manual remove/restore/delete + in-browser sample data (SHIPPED, PRs #494/#495, v3.5.330/331, live)
- **#494 (v3.5.330) — real manual-remove for Pipeline (archive-gated + restorable + permanent delete).** SKS had no way to manually remove Pipeline data: an Archive action existed but was ungated, unaudited and one-way (a tender vanished from the board with its data untouched and no way to see it again). `discardJob`/`removeProject` now require manager access and write an audit-log entry; a new "Show archived" list with Restore; and a manager-gated, explicit-confirm "Delete permanently" reachable only from the archived list. Hard-delete cascades the tender + nominations/pending_schedule/tender_enrichment; `tender_review_decisions` (no CASCADE FK) is cleared explicitly first. A matching DELETE policy on `tender_review_decisions` was applied to the SKS-live DB (Royce's separate go on prod RLS).
- **#495 (v3.5.331) — "Load sample data" for Pipeline / Resource Allocation / Account Explorer.** Fills all three with 12 fabricated (obviously-sample) tenders so the feature can be demoed to the internal EQ team. Nothing is fetched or written while on — reads swap to fake data locally, writes are blocked at the network layer across every save point (20+) as a backstop. Persistent banner + one-click exit. SKS-triple-gated; not click-tested live (no SKS login in-session).

## [2026-07-15] Mobile header-contrast audit — one live invisible-text bug fixed (SHIPPED, PRs #492/#493, live)
- Prompted by an SKS fix (mobile Weekly Roster header text going invisible — light background under inherited white text). Audited every table header across Contacts, Sites, Supervision, Job Numbers, Safety Report, Timesheets, Roster, Leave, Dashboard, Pipeline, Audits and Calibration.
- **#492 — Forecast page "Project" column header (white-on-white), fixed.** The header set a light background without resetting the inherited white text, so the label was invisible at every viewport width (not mobile-only). Verified the broken vs fixed rendering side-by-side before shipping.
- **#493 — Leave calendar weekday header (low-contrast on navy), fixed.** Opposite direction: the header left its background transparent so the navy page background showed through under dark-grey text; matched to `calendar.js`'s already-correct paired background+text. Pipeline import preview shares the pattern but was left as-is (not a mobile page, Royce's call).

## [2026-07-13] Mobile-improvement sprint — 4 PRs, v3.5.326→329 (SHIPPED, #486–#489, live, auto-merge per Royce)
- Claude proposed 8 mobile improvements off the back of the device-pass work; recon-first killed the ones already done (top-bar declutter already hidden ≤768px; worker-first landing already routes via Shell staff auto-mode + home tiles). 4 shipped:
- v3.5.326 (#486) **sticky form actions** — `.modal-footer` gets `position:sticky;bottom:0` on ≤768px, and the Prestart action row (`safety.js`) gained the sticky bar Toolbox/Diary already had. Submit/Save no longer scroll off a tall form. Verified 31 footers compute sticky on preview.
- v3.5.327 (#487) **skeleton loaders** — reusable `eqSkeleton()` (`utils.js`) + `.eqf-skel*` (`base.css`, reduced-motion aware). Dashboard's `?tab=dashboard` deep-link now shimmers instead of a bare spinner; roster's Job Numbers empty state → standard icon+action. Cold boot and other empty states were already covered — targeted, not a rewrite.
- v3.5.328 (#488) **gestures** — timesheets swipe-to-change-week (mirrors roster's existing pattern) + pull-to-refresh (`initPullToRefresh`, `index.html`; passive listeners, fixed pill, never calls `preventDefault`, arms only at `scrollTop 0`, skips modals). Interacts with v3.5.317's `overscroll-behavior-y: contain` (which killed the *native* pull-to-refresh) — this is an app-level `refreshData()` call instead, complementary but flagged for a device check.
- v3.5.329 (#489) **worker timesheet prefill** — the prefill tools (copy-last/from-roster/fill-from-Mon) were all supervisor-gated, so workers started every week blank. Staff mode now shows a "Prefill week" banner on a draft week with empty days; one tap fills per Royce's precedence rule (roster → last week), own row only, empty days only, never overwrites, always stays editable, hides once submitted/approved. `_computeMyWeekPrefill` precedence engine unit-proven on preview.
- Two items left for a real-device pass rather than shipped blind: pull-to-refresh feel (does it fight the v3.5.317 native-reload suppression?) and the full staff-mode prefill round-trip (banner → tap → fill → edit → submit) — the engine is unit-proven but the flow wasn't drivable from the headless preview (login-gated).

## [2026-07-14] Read-only Test Equipment calibration surface (SKS-gated) (SHIPPED, PR #490, live)
- New `scripts/calibration.js` `renderCalibration()`: a list (instrument, asset #, last calibrated, next due with overdue/near colour, status pill, certificate link) + per-item cert-history drill-in, reading canonical `app_data.asset_calibration` (embedding asset identity via the `asset_id` FK) + `app_data.asset_calibration_events`. New `sbFetchAppData()` bare-`app_data` read helper (mints the data-plane JWT + `Accept-Profile: app_data`; these tables have no `field_` twin so the generic `sbFetch` would misroute them).
- Nav item in the Safety group (ships `display:none`), SKS-only reveal in `applyTierVisibility`, lazy-loader entry, `sw.js` precache + cache bump. Read-only, no writes, XSS-safe (`esc()` throughout). Part of the cross-repo calibration single-source consolidation (shows data once eq-service #534 backfill is applied — done). `node --check` clean; live verification needs an authenticated field session (not reproducible in sandbox).
- Merged → main, deployed LIVE to field.eq.solutions, Netlify `state=ready`.

## [2026-07-13] v3.5.323 — PERF: trim the analytics recording layer (Field slow on phones) (SHIPPED, #484, live)
- Royce: slow navigating on both Android + iPhone. Profiled prod: Field's own tab navigation is 3.5–7.9ms — the cost was the analytics **recording** layer (both tenants): PostHog session replay (rrweb) + autocapture/dead-clicks/surveys/web-vitals, **plus Microsoft Clarity as a second continuous recorder**.
- Fix keeps all custom events/funnels; disables PostHog session recording + autocapture + surveys + performance + dead-clicks + heatmaps, disables Clarity on both tenants, and defers analytics init to `requestIdleCallback`. Preview-verified zero heavy analytics scripts load; PostHog core still up for events. Fully reversible (flip flags / paste Clarity IDs). Aligns with the "not a surveillance tool" charter.

## [2026-07-13] v3.5.317–322 — Mobile device-pass: 6 PRs from Royce's real-Android smoke (SHIPPED, #478–#483, live)
- **v3.5.317 (#478):** prestart photo-eviction data loss fixed (sessionStorage stash + rehydrate on tab-hide/return); accidental pull-to-refresh reload killed (`overscroll-behavior-y: contain` on root + `.content`, plain-mobile + shell-mode); timesheet orphaned-`staff_id` toast spam → console-only `note()` (with `setNoteSink` test hook).
- **v3.5.318 (#479):** Help tab removed (all 5 entry points; `#page-help` left unreachable); Sites search (name/code/address/lead, focus-stable); prestart/toolbox site datalist opens the full scrollable list on focus even when a site is set.
- **v3.5.319 (#480):** Add Site / payroll CSV bar / Job Numbers CSV+Import hidden on phone; `.hide-mobile` extended to shell-mode (Core-iframe touch WebView).
- **v3.5.320 (#481):** honest voice-input error inside the Core iframe — Chrome blocks the Web Speech API cross-origin even with `allow="microphone"`; message now points embedded users to a browser tab. Standalone unchanged.
- **v3.5.321 (#482):** phone Roster decluttered — day switcher (default today) + collapsible crew sections + one chip per person; desktop grid untouched. Synthetic-render-verified on the deploy-preview.
- **v3.5.322 (#483):** supervisor timesheet card tidy — 44px tap targets, hide empty meta divider. CSS-only.
- Findings surfaced, not built: Pipeline/Resources already unreachable on phone; supervisor "my-hours" is a separate PIN-auth mode (feature, not reroute) — left per Royce (workers already self-submit; supervisor phone view already card-based). Open: **#4 dropdown/form-field pickers** (awaiting Royce screenshot); #1 "slow" (device + payload, needs real-device profile).

## [2026-07-13] v3.5.309–316 — Mobile reflow slices + device-pass polish (SHIPPED, PRs #469/#474/#475/#476, live)
- Companion slices to the v3.5.310–312 mobile-card work (#470/#471/#472). Each shipped to field.eq.solutions.
- **v3.5.309 (#469) — mobile shell respects security groups.** Bottom nav / drawer / home tiles were role-blind; now gated via `EQ_PERMS` (new `applyMobileNavPerms` + home-tile gating) so labour_hire no longer sees Leave/Roster/Team/Contacts it can't action. Employee/apprentice unchanged; unresolved-role sessions never over-hidden.
- **v3.5.314 (#474) — device-pass polish (7 fixes from Royce's phone).** Dropped the `◉` glyph that rendered as a speckle on the "this week" week-picker; **root-caused the stuck "↑ Saving…" pill** (a 4xx write threw without releasing `_pendingWriteCount` in supabase.js → hung forever; now the 4xx path clears it + a 15s watchdog for a hung fetch); symmetric ±16-week contiguous week-nav window (prev-week jumped across gaps); Labour Hire stat-card icon fix; removed a long Timesheets helper paragraph; hid the unused EQ Agent FAB; retired the Prestart dual-source banner.
- **v3.5.315 (#475) — home launcher tiles migrated onto `.eqf-mcard`.** All 10 tiles in `home.js` carry the shared primitive; `home.css` drops the now-redundant background/border/radius (computed-style parity verified). Unifies the last of the four bespoke phone-card envelopes.
- **v3.5.316 (#476) — mobile drawer icons → consistent Lucide.** The `#mobile-drawer` slide-up menu mixed geometric Unicode + colour emoji (misleading on a phone); swapped all 21 `.d-icon` for inline Lucide SVGs (`stroke:currentColor` so they tint with row state — navy active / green unlocked / red log-out); the manager-lock row toggles lock⇄lock-open.

## [2026-07-13] v3.5.312 — Mobile reflow slice 2: Dashboard / Job Numbers / Leave calendar → .eqf-mcard (SHIPPED, PR #472, live)
- Three dense desktop tables that side-scrolled or squashed at 375px now dual-render a stacked phone-card view on the shared `.eqf-mcard` primitive (from v3.5.310), flipping desktop↔mobile at ≤768px via new `.eqf-mobonly`/`.eqf-deskonly` helpers.
- Dashboard "Site Breakdown — Per Day": per-site card with a Mon–Fri crew-density count strip. Job Numbers: per-job card with status-coloured left-border + the same manager actions (shared `jnActions()`). Leave calendar: per-day agenda of only days-with-leave.
- No auth/routing/schema change. Stacked on #470's primitive; merged after #470 (v3.5.310) and alongside #471 (v3.5.311 page-body overflow-x:clip clamp).

## [2026-07-13] Crew-add now confirms on mobile + "What's new" banner retired (SHIPPED, PR #473, `330c285`, v3.5.313, live)
- Follow-up to #468 from Royce's phone: after typing a crew name you couldn't tell if it was added (the manual add showed no toast, unlike "Pull from roster", and the new row sits above the on-screen keyboard). `_psAddCrew`/`_tbAddAtt` now show an "Added <name>" toast and `scrollIntoView` the input (prestart crew + toolbox attendance); the toolbox attendee input gained the same Enter/Go-to-add as the prestart crew input (#468 parity).
- Also retired the noisy "What's new — vX.Y.Z" banner — `_renderWhatsNew` is now a no-op that keeps the element hidden (element + dismiss handler + highlights kept as harmless no-ops; revive by restoring the function). Rebased clean onto main through the concurrent mobile-reflow release train (#469→#472, v3.5.308→312); only version stamps re-touched. `node --check` verified. Still open: the "Ben says to use EQ Field" chip Royce spotted is NOT in Field code (no live "Ritchie" string) — likely Shell-side, tracing once screenshotted.

## [2026-07-13] Prestart could not be submitted on mobile, with no error shown (SHIPPED, PR #468, `6333737`, v3.5.308, live)
- Surfaced by the eq-shell mobile audit device pass: on a phone, a prestart's camera worked but you couldn't add a crew name or submit — and nothing said why. Root cause was NOT permissions/RLS (write path is healthy — tenant-isolation RLS, `authenticated` INSERT, JWT-fill trigger, no perm gate in `safety.js`): the client-side add-crew failed on mobile → `crew_n=0` → `canSubmitPrestart` false → Submit rendered `disabled`/greyed, and tapping a disabled button gives zero feedback. Compounded by `_qPersist` disguising ANY online write-rejection (incl. 401/403) as "saved locally, will sync" while `submitPrestart` also showed "submitted ✓" (double false-success), and `_qIsPermanentErr` only dead-lettering 400/404 (401/403 retried forever, never surfaced).
- Fix (all `scripts/safety.js`): blocked Submit is now tappable + toasts the exact missing step; crew "add a name" also fires on the phone keyboard Enter/Go (the Add button can sit under the keyboard); `_qPersist` no longer disguises a 4xx server rejection as offline-saved and returns `{_error}` so callers don't paint false success; `_qIsPermanentErr` now dead-letters 400/401/403/404/409/422 (408/5xx stay retryable). node+VM verified (23 asserts). **Topology confirmed = eq-field** (hardcoded `sks → eq-field.netlify.app` in `src/lib/fieldTenants.ts`), NOT sks-nsw-labour — the umbrella deploy note is stale for this flow. OPEN: Royce to device-confirm the add-crew reachability on his phone (exact mobile mechanism unproven from code; Enter-to-add is the safe slice, may still need a layout pass).

## [2026-07-13] Security: closed 4 automation edge functions triggerable by anonymous callers (SHIPPED, PR #463, live)
- Added a caller-auth guard (`supabase/functions/_shared/cron-auth.ts`) to supervisor-digest / shift-events / tafe-weekly-fill; pinned tafe-weekly-fill to its own tenant (was overridable via request body); added an interim hourly abuse-cap to ts-reminder. Deployed all 4 to ehow (`--no-verify-jwt`), verified anon → 401 (×3) / 500 fail-closed (×1).
- **CI guardrail — `tests/edge-fn-auth.test.js` (PR #465).** Fails the build if any edge function ships without a caller-auth marker; rides the existing test loop (no workflow change).
- Dependabot for github-actions (PR #466 — since merged; 4 follow-up version-bump PRs #501–#504 opened and merged 2026-07-20).

## [2026-07-12] v3.5.306 — In-app Remove / Restore / Delete people lifecycle (SHIPPED, PR #462, live)
- Fixes the archive/delete flow on canonical (SKS). Both "Archive" and "Delete permanently" only ever set `staff.active=false`, which the active-only `field_people` view hides — so removed people vanished, Restore was dead, "Show archived" was always empty, and Delete additionally wiped roster history (lossy).
- New two-step lifecycle, entirely in-app (no bounce to Core, no refresh): active rows get **📦 Remove from roster** (reversible, keeps all history); **Show removed** reveals removed people (lazily loaded from a new companion twin); removed rows get **↺ Restore** or **✕ Delete permanently** (supervisor-only, blocked server-side when roster/timesheet/leave/licence history exists so real history is never nuked).
- DB (ehow + zaap): companion view `app_data.field_people_removed` (`security_invoker=on` → RLS tenant-isolated) + `INSTEAD OF UPDATE` (restore) / `DELETE` (hard-purge) trigger, SECURITY DEFINER + explicit tenant guard. Client: JWT twin `people_removed`; `STATE.peopleArchived` kept OUT of `STATE.people` so roster/timesheets/dropdowns never see removed people. Managers unchanged (Core-managed / read-only on SKS). SEED tenants (eq/demo) run the lifecycle in-memory — zaap's `field_people` is a thin drifted view with no `archived` column.
- Data hygiene alongside: 23 test/duplicate `app_data.staff` rows purged from the SKS spine (Sam Powell's real EWP licence merged onto his live record first). Also fixed a live `canon-read` 500 — the eq-field Netlify project was missing `CANONICAL_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (jvkn service_role); set + verified.
- **Governance follow-up (PR #464, MERGED `89a2e0a`):** the `field_people_removed` view + `INSTEAD OF` trigger DDL above was applied out-of-band during this release. Now captured in a governed migration (`supabase/migrations/20260712_field_people_removed_lifecycle.sql`) so it reproduces on a fresh plane, mirroring the `field_job_numbers` `20260704b` pattern. No live change (verified byte-identical no-op on ehow via a rolled-back transaction); not re-applied — the full-column view would error on zaap's thin-drifted `staff` until backfilled.

## [2026-07-12] v3.5.304 — Degraded-sync observability + preserve-on-failure (SHIPPED, PR #459, live)
- Parity with SKS NSW Labour v3.10.93 (#60), reached via Field's own resilience model — Field was never exposed to the SKS `Promise.all` freeze (per-fetch `_loadSafe`, v3.5.201), so this closes only the two remaining gaps.
- **Preserve-on-failure**: a failed core-table fetch on the 30s/5min background poll used to blank the roster/Contacts for ≥30s — the fetch fell back to an empty set that overwrote currently-good data (Field has no last-good read snapshot). Now a failed fetch keeps the last-known data: the five core loads (people/sites/schedule/managers/timesheets) each skip their STATE write on failure (via a `_LOAD_FAILED` sentinel) instead of emptying. Cold boot unchanged (state starts empty anyway).
- **Observability**: a degraded or fully-failed core sync now raises a toast + a `sync_degraded` analytics event (`kind` partial/failed, failed table names, count) + a console breadcrumb — fired once on the healthy→degraded edge, not every poll tick. Turns a previously silent, console-only partial outage into something operators actually see. Effectively SKS-only (the eq sandbox loads from seed; the demo slug is in-memory, so neither hits the fetch path).
- No DB / schema / auth change; client-only, dependency-free. Verified live in the deploy preview by driving the health-signal state machine before merge.

## [2026-07-12] v3.5.303 — Birthday + Start date columns; Supervision read-only on SKS (SHIPPED, PR #458, live)
- Contacts gains two optional columns — **Birthday** (day + month, no year) and **Start date** — available from the Columns picker for every Group segment (hidden by default). The data already lived on each person and is edited in the Add/Edit Person modal; this just surfaces it in the table. Mirrors the same two columns added to Core's Staff list (eq-shell #771).
- Supervision is now read-only on SKS: the "＋ Add Contact" button is hidden and `openAddManager` is guarded (row edit/archive/delete were already SKS-hidden). SKS supervisors are managed in Core (Shell Staff → Supervisor toggle); Field is view-only for them. EQ tenants unchanged.

## [2026-07-12] order=id 400s on id-less tables (SHIPPED, PR #460, v3.5.305, live)
- `sbFetchAll('team_members?select=*')` and `sbFetchAll('timesheet_locks?select=*')` passed no `orderBy` → default `order=id` 400s (no `id` column: PKs `team_id,person_id` / `week_key,org_id`). Passed each PK. Both already guarded (try/catch) so they degraded silently rather than freezing — unlike SKS, where the same calls sat in an unguarded `Promise.all` and caused the v3.10.90→.92 outage. Meant to fold into #459 but that merged first; clean follow-up. SKS #59 parity.

## [2026-07-12] eq tenant → Core-only sign-in, Phase 1 (config-only, no version bump)
- `core.eq.solutions/eq/field` now signs EQ staff straight through Core with no demo PIN gate. Zero eq-field code change: the whole fix was a missing `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` env var on the eq-field Netlify site (`field.eq.solutions`, a separate site from SKS's `sks-nsw-labour`) → `verifySupabaseJwt()` returned null → the Shell handoff was rejected → demo-gate fallback. Royce set the secret (fingerprint verified against eq-shell's) and redeployed; smoked live. Lesson: Netlify bakes env into functions at deploy time, so an env fix does nothing until a redeploy. (The full standalone-PIN strip + supervisor-backdoor removal landed later as #461/#506, v3.5.333, 2026-07-20.)

## [2026-07-11] Undefined-name safety net completed — `no-undef` ON (SHIPPED, PR #438, v3.5.261, `b71fa16`, live)
- Directly closes the `ReferenceError: isLeave is not defined` bug class that stranded the boot spinner (see v3.5.284 below). eq-field is build-less vanilla HTML/JS, so its self-contained flat ESLint config had `no-undef` OFF (no module graph to resolve cross-file globals) — meaning lint could not catch a call to an undeclared name. Fixed by *deriving* the globals from source: new `deriveAppGlobals()` reads every `scripts/*.js` + the inline `<script>` blocks in `index.html`/`404.html` and extracts top-level declarations, including `window.`/`self.`/`globalThis.` assignments at any indentation.
- Result: 3000+ false positives → 0 errors, 693 warnings, `no-undef` set to `error`; all 5 headless tests pass. Consistency guard vs canonical `@eq-solutions/roles` shipped the same day (v3.5.261): Field's own `permission-matrix.js` (~50 fine-grained perms) must stay a role-key subset of the canonical `EqRole` enum — a warn-only startup guard flags either direction of drift, never throws, never changes a permission decision. `subcontractor` recorded as intentionally excluded from Field (roster `employment_type` only, never a Field login role).

## [2026-07-11] Boot perf: JSZip off the render-blocking critical path (SHIPPED, PR #452, v3.5.296, `8d3eca6`, live)
- Field was the slowest EQ app (~4.3s to interactive; live-profiled) — bottleneck was ~595 KB of render-blocking `<head>` JS, not data (the data layer is already parallelised + window-scoped). JSZip (~95 KB, the single biggest boot script, used only for user-triggered prestart/toolbox/audit `.docx` export, never at boot) moved from an eager `<head>` `<script>` to a `requestIdleCallback` loader — every export callsite already guards `typeof JSZip === 'undefined'`; sw.js still precaches it (offline export intact). Also: `print.css` → `media="print"` (was render-blocking; already fully `@media print`-wrapped so no visual change); `<link rel="preconnect">` to canonical jvkn.
- **Honest caveat:** a fourth change (index.html `no-store`→`no-cache`) is live but a no-op for boot — the `for="/index.html"` rule doesn't apply to `/`, the path the Shell iframe loads, which already gets Netlify's 304-capable default; the profiling "698 KB re-downloads every boot" was a config misread. The jszip win is the real one, verified live (eager `<script>` gone).

## [2026-07-11] v3.5.302 — Person phone normalised to +61 (E.164) on save (SHIPPED, PR #457, live)
- Editing a person now stores their phone in one canonical E.164 form (`+61…`) instead of a mix of `04…`/`+61…`/`61…`. New `toAuE164` (`scripts/utils.js`) is a general AU normaliser — handles mobiles AND landlines, and returns anything unrecognisable unchanged, so a save can never wipe or mangle a phone. Applied in `savePerson`.
- Mirrors eq-shell's server-side `toAuE164` (#761) so Core and Field store the same form. Dedup unaffected (already keys on last-9 digits). A one-time backfill of existing rows to `+61` was run live alongside (ehow + zaap).

## [2026-07-11] v3.5.301 — Off-roster people hidden from Roster + Timesheets (SHIPPED, PR #454, live)
- People turned off the roster in Core (Shell Staff page → "Show on roster") no longer appear in the **Roster** grid, the **Timesheets** grid, or the timesheet **completion stats** — they stay in Contacts. Lets office-based managers stay reachable without cluttering the roster.
- Reads `app_data.staff.on_roster` via the existing `field_people` view (Shell owns the flag; Field only honours it). `NULL`/default `true` = on-roster, so every existing person is unaffected until explicitly toggled off. No schema change.
- Re-stamped v3.5.299→301 at merge (version race with #455) and rebased through main; changelog reordered newest-first.

## [2026-07-11] v3.5.300 — Add/Edit Person → compact modal; person-wizard retired (SHIPPED, PR #456, live)
- **The full-page 3-step "person wizard" is removed** (`page-person-wizard` / `wizardSave` / `renderPersonWizard` / `pf-*`). Add/Edit Person now opens the compact `#modal-person`. The wizard was the only wired flow and its save was fire-and-forget with no error handling — a failed write showed "added" then the person vanished on refresh. This is the fix for Royce's "person wizard doesn't work".
- **Reliable save:** `savePerson()` now awaits the write and only updates the roster + closes on success; on failure it keeps the modal open, shows "Save failed", and rolls back the optimistic edit. New rows get a real UUID (not the legacy numeric `max+1`).
- **Adopt-before-create dedup:** adding someone already on the roster (matched by last-9 phone or lowercased email against loaded people) opens their record instead of minting a duplicate stub.
- Modal reaches field parity: **Job Title, Emergency Contact, Subcontractor** added. Add stays hidden on SKS (staff come from Core/Cards, per Royce); Edit works on every tenant. Smoke-verified on the deploy preview (editPerson opens + prefills; dedup matches all AU phone formats).

## [2026-07-11] v3.5.298 — Safety offline queue unwedged: stale sks_rep payload + poison-pill replay (SHIPPED, PR #451, live)
- **BUG:** Safety showed "1 pending offline write" permanently on SKS. A prestart queued offline ~25 June (pre-v3.5.220 build) still carried the old `sks_rep` field name; the live `prestarts` column is `site_rep` (renamed client-side in v3.5.220, but entries already in the queue kept the stale key). Every replay 400'd (`PGRST204: could not find the 'sks_rep' column`) and went straight back in the queue — a poison pill re-firing on every Safety open, with no exit because the replay loop treated all failures as retryable.
- **FIX (`safety.js _qReplay`):** (1) queued payloads are normalised on replay (`sks_rep`→`site_rep`), so the stuck June prestart actually lands in the DB — the record is rescued, not discarded; (2) entries that fail with a permanent 400/404 are parked in a `<queueKey>_dead` localStorage key (payload + error + timestamp kept, Sentry-captured with the full payload) and removed from the live queue, so the pending pill can no longer wedge. Transient failures (network/401/403/5xx) still retry as before. Same permanent-4xx dead-letter guard added to `site-reports-shared.js replay()` (site_reports/diaries/toolbox v2 queues had the identical retry-forever flaw; no rename there — `site_reports` genuinely has an `sks_rep` column).
- No DB change — live `prestarts` schema verified correct on ehow first.
- **Renumbered v3.5.296→298 at merge:** a concurrent session's JSZip boot-perf PR #452 took v3.5.296 and the capacity panel PR #453 took v3.5.297 while this was open; conflicts resolved by hand. Prod verified serving v3.5.298.

## [2026-07-11] v3.5.297 — Resource Allocation capacity panel: labour-curve jobs light it up + demand-scaled chart (SHIPPED, PR #453, live)
- **BUG:** the Capacity Planning panel (SKS Resource Allocation) stayed on the "Set start dates and worker counts on Won jobs…" empty state for jobs planned with a **Labour Curve** (phases). The chart's demand builder fully supported phases, but the render GATE only checked the flat `peak_workers` + `duration_weeks` enrichment fields — so SKS-16310 (confirmed, start date + 3 phases, flat fields empty) never rendered the chart, the roster strip, or its WORKERS/WEEKS table numbers.
- **FIX:** new `_isAllocated()` gate matches the builder (start date + phases OR peak+duration). WORKERS/WEEKS columns, the mini-timeline and the job colour chip now derive from the curve (max phase headcount / total phase weeks) when the flat fields are empty.
- **Design (reviewed live-data "Mock B" before build):** panel reads **roster-first** — the THIS WEEK strip (N on the roster · N free · N jobs live · N needed) moved above the stat tiles. Chart **scales to demand, not headcount** — with 90 on the books vs 4–12-crew jobs the old `max(HC, demand)` y-scale rendered every real job as near-flat bars under an HC line pinned to the top; the HC dashed line now draws only when demand is within reach of headcount, otherwise it rides in the legend as an "HC N — no week exceeds it" chip (per-week exceeds-HC red outlines unchanged). Peak-demand tile names its week.
- **"Save phases" now rebuilds the unpushed labour plan** (`pending_schedule`) to match the current curve — previously slots were generated once at Save & Confirm, so a phase added later diverged silently (SKS-16310 showed "66 to assign" from its confirm-time curve while the edited curve implied 114). Same safety rule as details-edit: rows already pushed to the live roster are never touched.
- SKS-only surface (`sks-pipeline-resource.js`), no DB change. Design-review artifact: https://claude.ai/code/artifact/160c2243-ae48-43ca-8c7e-bcadb4343659

## [2026-07-11] v3.5.295 — SKS auth audit trail now visible in-app: stamp CANONICAL org_id (SHIPPED, PR #450, live)
- **BUG:** every server-side auth event on SKS (`verify-pin` logins, `eq-agent` calls) was stored in `audit_log` but INVISIBLE in the in-app Audit view. The Netlify functions stamped `org_id = TENANT_ORG_UUID` (the legacy field_org_id `1eb831f9-…`), while `audit_log`'s RLS + the Audit view read as the SKS `authenticated` JWT filtered to the canonical org `000…002` — the org the client and every hardened `public.*` table use. Mismatch → 600+ login rows since 2026-06-30 landed (service_role bypasses RLS) yet never showed. Drift from the 06-25/06-30 canonical hardening: migrations moved SKS `public.*` to `000…002`; the Netlify env was never updated.
- **The documented diagnosis was STALE** (verified live on ehow 2026-07-11): schema is complete, `AUDIT_SB_KEY` is already `service_role`, verify-pin DOES stamp org_id, writes land daily. The fault was the org_id *value*, not the key/columns. CLAUDE.md schema-gotcha note corrected in the same PR.
- **FIX (code, per-tenant):** `logAttempt()`/`logAgentCall()` resolve `AUDIT_ORG_BY_TENANT` (`sks:000…002`) from the request's tenant slug and stamp THAT. Shell-handoff paths (token/cookie/supabase-jwt) pass the slug; the standalone PIN path (EQ sandbox) omits it → falls back to `TENANT_ORG_UUID`, so EQ behaviour is unchanged. One Netlify site serves both tenants, so this MUST resolve per-request — a single `TENANT_ORG_UUID` env flip was rejected because it would misroute the EQ demo gate's PIN lookup. Override via `AUDIT_ORG_BY_TENANT_JSON`.
- **Forward-only (Royce's call):** the 743 historical mis-stamped rows are left as-is (stored, not lost). No env change, no data migration.
- Bonus finding (not fixed, moot): the same wrong env makes `fetchPinCodesFromDB()` miss every `app_config` row (all `000…002`) → env-PIN fallback; harmless on SKS (Core-only, PIN gate disabled).
- Prod verified serving v3.5.295. Runtime proof (a new `Auth` row on `000…002`) pending the first post-deploy SKS sign-in — deterministic map lookup; not yet observed live at time of merge.

## [2026-07-11] v3.5.294 — mark "SKS leave shows 0" formally RESOLVED in the changelog banner (SHIPPED, PR #449, live)
- Doc-only: added a ✅ RESOLVED status marker to the in-HTML changelog banner (the canonical changelog for v3.5+). No behaviour change. Prod verified serving the marker. Closes the multi-session leave-shows-0 saga in-repo.

## [2026-07-11] Timesheets tab — checked, NO fix needed (no release)
- Asked to apply the leave fix to timesheets. Verified it does NOT have the same gap: timesheets are fetched at BOOT inside `loadFromSupabase`'s main Promise.all (`sbFetch('timesheets?select=*'+weekFilter)`, index.html:8295) → `STATE.timesheets` is populated before any tab renders. Leave was the exception (moved out of the boot fetch into the lazy `loadLeaveRequests()`); timesheets never left the boot path. Verified live on `core.eq.solutions/sks/field?tab=timesheets` (deep-linked, no other tab first): full grid, 88 staff tracked, real hours/codes. No dead `_ensureTimesheetsLoaded` shipped.

## [2026-07-11] v3.5.293 — Dashboard leave strip loads authoritative leave data (SHIPPED, PR #448, live & VERIFIED)
- Follow-up to v3.5.291. The home Dashboard "Leave & Absences This Week" strip read the global `leaveRequests`, but that array was only populated by the Leave tab's `_ensureLeaveLoaded()` (leave.js is lazy → boot-time `loadLeaveRequests()` skipped). On a deep-linked `?tab=dashboard` (how Core lands users) the strip showed only the roster A/L overlay fallback, never the real `leave_requests`.
- Fix: `renderDashboard()` kicks the SAME cached one-shot — lazy-loading leave.js first if needed — and re-renders when data lands. Once per session (`renderDashboard._leaveKicked`); shared `_leaveInitialLoad` promise = single fetch, no double-load with the Leave tab; degrades to the roster overlay on failure; leave.js stays lazy (no boot-parse regression).
- **Verified live on `core.eq.solutions/sks/field?tab=dashboard`** (no Leave-tab visit first): full A/L/RDO/OFF absences list + a "PENDING LEAVE 1" card (Tadhg Byrne). Pending status comes only from `leave_requests`, so that card proves the authoritative data loaded.

## [2026-07-11] v3.5.291/292 — ✅ THE leave-shows-0 fix: leave list was never fetched on a deep-linked open (SHIPPED, PRs #446/#447, live & VERIFIED)
- **RESOLVED the multi-session "SKS leave shows 0" bug. Verified live on `core.eq.solutions/sks/field?tab=leave`: PENDING 1 / OFF THIS WEEK 10 / APPROVED 15; on-screen diagnostic confirmed `status:200, leaveCanon:true, rows:31`.**
- **True root cause (proven, not inferred):** routing was correct all along (BOOT_DIAG banner read `slug=sks, SB_URL=ehow, canon=TRUE`). The leave READ never ran: `leave.js` is lazy-loaded so `initApp()`'s boot `loadLeaveRequests()` is skipped (undefined then); `renderLeave()` only renders; realtime does no initial read; the 30s poll is suppressed under realtime. On a deep-linked `?tab=leave` (how Core embeds Field) `leaveRequests` was never populated. The panel's "↺ Refresh" was `onclick=renderLeave()` — a pure re-render. 31 rows never lost, never fetched.
- **Fix (v3.5.291, PR #446):** `renderLeave()` → `_ensureLeaveLoaded()`, a cached-promise one-shot that fetches on first tab open and re-renders when data lands.
- **v3.5.292 (PR #447):** removed all temporary diagnostics (BOOT_DIAG/LEAVE_DIAG banners, `__eqDiag`, Sentry LEAVE_DIAG) — they were user-visible on the leave screen.
- **Diagnostic method that finally worked:** an on-screen banner read off a screenshot — the only channel that pierces a cross-origin + storage-partitioned embedded iframe (console needs the user; localStorage is partitioned; Sentry is silent from the embedded frame).

## [2026-07-11] v3.5.286/287 — canonical gate keyed on the resolved DB + window.SB_URL refresh (SHIPPED, PRs #439/#440, live) — necessary, not sufficient
- **v3.5.286 (PR #439):** leave/roster/timesheets canonical-mode gates now return true when the resolved tenant DB (`window.SB_URL`) is the SKS plane (ehow), as well as when `TENANT.ORG_SLUG==='sks'`. Removes the single-point-of-failure slug dependency so an embedded-restore slug hiccup can't route SKS to the service_role-only twin (→401→empty). `window.SB_URL` exposed in app-state.js. `app_data.leave_requests` (with data) exists only on ehow so the DB match can't over-trigger on eq/zaap. (Verified in isolation: gate returns true for an ehow URL even with a broken slug.)
- **v3.5.287 (PR #440):** `sbFetch` refreshes `window.SB_URL` from the lexical `SB_URL` on every call — closes any resolve-path that set SB_URL without re-exposing it.
- These were real fragility fixes (canon WAS slug-fragile) but did not fix leave — because the read never fired (see v3.5.291). v3.5.288–290 were temporary diagnostics, all removed in v3.5.292.

## [2026-07-10] THE stuck-spinner fix: `refreshData()` stranded the overlay (SHIPPED, PR #437, v3.5.285, live)
- The recurring /sks/field "spinner of death" that came back ~30s after every clean boot. `loadFromSupabase()` unconditionally calls `showLoadingOverlay()` and has two callers — `initApp()` (boot) and `refreshData()` (the 30s + 5min polls, realtime changes, manual Sync). v3.5.255 moved the HIDE out of `loadFromSupabase()` into `initApp()`'s tail but left the SHOW in `loadFromSupabase`, so every background poll re-showed the full-page overlay with nothing to hide it.
- Fix: overlay ownership → the caller — `loadFromSupabase()` shows nothing; `initApp()` shows before the call + hides in the finally; `refreshData()` shows nothing (a silent poll must never flash a full-page overlay; manual Sync keeps its button + toast feedback). Companion to eq-shell #725 (Clarity CSP). Ruled out as red herrings: the CSP console noise, the `browser.sentry-cdn.com/*.js.map` block, and React #418 (a browser extension).

## [2026-07-10] Boot-path spinner: unguarded secondary loaders (SHIPPED, PR #435, v3.5.284, live)
- `initApp()` awaited six loaders after `loadFromSupabase()`; `loadFromSupabase` self-guards but those six did NOT, so any one throwing (concretely `ReferenceError: isLeave is not defined` — a raw roster.js helper hit before roster.js lazy-loads) propagated out of the fire-and-forget `initApp()` (no `.catch`) and skipped `hideLoadingOverlay()`, stranding the spinner over an already-rendered dashboard.
- Fix, defence in depth: each secondary loader wrapped in its own try/catch; `hideLoadingOverlay()` moved into a finally; a last-resort `.catch` on the `initApp()` call; plus an early global `isLeave()` fallback (mirrors roster.js from `LEAVE_TERMS`, overridden on load) so the raw-call ReferenceError can't fire at boot. Rebased over #434 (version-stamp race). This fixed only the boot path — see v3.5.285 above for the recurrence.

## [2026-07-10] Shell handoff self-heals on iframe restore (SHIPPED, PR #431, v3.5.280, live)
- Root cause of the recurring /sks/field "spinner of death" on tab-return: the browser memory-saver discards the backgrounded Field iframe; on restore it reboots on the hash-stripped URL (the `#sh=` was consumed + `replaceState`'d on first boot), Field restores its session from sessionStorage silently, and Shell — never hearing `accepted` — sticks on `booted` and paints a fatal card over a fully-working Field.
- Fix: every silent restore path (sessionStorage, remember-me local, remember token) now posts `{kind:'accepted'}` to the parent; `_verifyShellToken` failures go silent when a live session already exists (stale token restored from the iframe `src` attr); and a boot with nothing to restore requests a fresh token over the existing-but-never-called `REQUEST_SHELL_TOKEN` bridge (5s timeout) before dead-ending at the SKS-locked gate. Standalone boots skip all of it; postMessages stay origin-pinned to core.eq.solutions. Companion to eq-shell #718/#723.

## [2026-07-10] Contacts: segment-aware columns + Columns picker (SHIPPED, PR #430, v3.5.278→279, live)
- Desktop table columns now follow the Group filter instead of one fixed set with dashes everywhere (Royce: "Agency only relevant for labour hire"): All=Name·Group·Job Title·Phone·Email; Labour Hire=Name·Agency·Phone·Email; Apprentice=Name·Year·TAFE Day·Phone·Email; Direct/Sub=Name·Job Title·Phone·Email. Group column drops when a group is filtered; birthday/anniversary badges moved to the Name cell so they survive it.
- New "Columns" picker (Lucide sliders, next to CSV, desktop only) — instant-apply checkboxes, per-segment + per-tenant `localStorage` memory, Reset. View-only: CSV exports read `STATE.people` (all fields), unchanged. Under the hood both desktop render paths (virtual + non-virtual) now build from one `CONTACTS_COLUMNS` registry (killed a 3-way HTML duplication); badge helpers hoisted to module scope + shared with the unchanged mobile card path.

## [2026-07-10] v3.5.283 — honor ?tenant= override whenever iframe-embedded (SHIPPED, PR #434, live) — DID NOT FIX SKS LEAVE
- Intended as THE root-cause fix for "SKS leave shows 0": a live diagnostic showed the leave adapter was loaded but its canonical gate returned false (`TENANT.ORG_SLUG` ≠ 'sks'). Theory: Shell embeds Field at `eq-field.netlify.app` (matches no canonical tenant hostname) so `?tenant=sks` is the only thing making it SKS, and a backgrounded iframe reboots with the `#sh=` hash stripped → the override was rejected → session fell back to 'eq'. Fix honors the override whenever `window!==window.top`.
- **STATUS: did NOT resolve the symptom.** Leave was still 0 after deploy + fresh reload. Root cause is confirmed (`canon:false`) but this fix didn't correct it — the exact reason ORG_SLUG lands wrong is still unknown (needs the runtime `TENANT.ORG_SLUG` value). See `eq/pending.md` 🔴 UNRESOLVED entry.
- ⚠️ Also: spinner-of-death recurred on SKS after this merge (likely rapid SW-cache churn across 4 same-day deploys, not this code). Revert candidate if it persists.

## [2026-07-10] v3.5.282 — leave_requests is the single source of truth; roster overlays it live (SHIPPED, PR #433, live)
- Model change: retired the approve→`writeLeaveToSchedule` write-back. The roster and dashboard now COMPUTE approved leave at render from `leave_requests` (new `overlayApprovedLeave()` in roster.js — read-only, never mutates STATE.schedule). Leave wins for display; a site rostered under approved leave shows a ⚠ conflict marker instead of being silently hidden.
- `dashboard.js` "Leave & Absences This Week" reads `leave_requests` (approved, overlapping the week), unioned with manual roster absences so typed A/L/OFF still show.
- Fixes the SKS symptom where 30 bulk-imported approved-leave records never appeared on the roster (the old write-back only fired on UI approval). No DB change.

## [2026-07-10] v3.5.281 — SKS leave showed 0: precache the canonical adapters (SHIPPED, PR #432, live)
- Root cause: `leave-adapter.js`/`timesheets-adapter.js`/`roster-adapter.js` were network-only (not in the SW precache). When `leave-adapter.js` failed to execute, `EQ_LEAVE_ADAPTER` was undefined → supabase.js's leave read silently fell through to the `app_data.field_leave_requests` twin, which is service_role-only (`authenticated` → 401) → empty Leave surface with no error, while 31 real records sat in the DB.
- Fix: precache all three adapters so their globals can never be missing; add a loud `canonical-adapter-missing` breadcrumb in supabase.js if a leave/timesheets/schedule read ever runs without its adapter. Verified live: the authenticated JWT reads all 31 rows from `app_data.leave_requests` directly (data, grants, RLS, tenant isolation all correct). No DB change.

## [2026-07-10] v3.5.278 — migrated SKS site deployments now render their code (SHIPPED, PR #429, live)
- Fix: 704 real SKS roster deployments (across 19 sites) were invisible — blank cells. The canonical migration wrote `schedule_entries` rows with a real `site_id` but no free-text `task`, and `roster-adapter.js` reads the wide cell text from `task` with no `site_id`→code resolver wired (the documented `_warnSiteGapOnce` "site linkage is a follow-up" gap). Built the read-side resolver: `app_data.sites` (site_id→short code) is loaded alongside the staff map on the same JWT, and `cellFromRow()` renders the site's code (SYD53/ARN/STG/…) for a row with a site_id but no task. `scripts/roster-adapter.js`, `scripts/supabase.js`.
- Precedence preserved + tested (8 new golden tests, 87 pass): typed `task` still wins (lossless carrier), leave markers still win (on-leave ≠ deployed), unresolved/codeless site_id → blank as before. Site read is non-fatal (failure leaves cells blank, never breaks the staff map or boot).
- Spot-checked live before building (Royce's call): the 704 rows are sound — real staff, 19 real sites all with clean codes, weekdays only, 0 double-bookings, 0 orphans. `app_data.sites` read verified: `authenticated` has SELECT, `sites_tenant_isolation` RLS uses the identical JWT qual as the working `staff_tenant_isolation`.
- Read-only sugar: write path unchanged, so a first edit converts a newly-visible cell to a normal text cell (site code preserved). A full read+write canonical roster model is a larger, post-cutover follow-up. **Not visually confirmed on a live SKS session** (no SKS creds in-session) — Royce to eyeball the roster for w/c 2026-07-06.

## [2026-07-09] v3.5.273 — Revert now works for SKS roster edits (SHIPPED, PR #424, live)
- Fix: Revert on an SKS roster audit entry did nothing but silently show "can't be reverted" — closes the "structurally non-functional" gap deferred in v3.5.271. Canonical (SKS) roster rows carry no `target_id` (a reconstructed wide WEEK row spans up to 7 separate `schedule_entries` rows, one per day). `revertAuditEntry()` now resolves `staff_id` + `date` from the name/week/day already on every roster audit row, and reuses the same `classifyCell()` the save path trusts to compute the reverted write. `scripts/audit.js`, `scripts/supabase.js`.
- The Revert button's own visibility gate still hard-required `target_id` after the above landed, so it never rendered for SKS and the fixed click handler was unreachable — caught on a deliberate adversarial self-review before shipping; both now share one `_auditRowCanRevert()` gate. Reverting a cell to blank is deliberately out of scope for SKS (declines with a message) — the canonical DELETE path has a tenant-wide-purge fallback not safe to extend in the same pass.

## [2026-07-10] v3.5.277 — paginate the remaining capped reads that should be complete (SHIPPED, PR #428, live)
- Completes the pagination sweep (after v3.5.274's no-limit reads and v3.5.276/#427's pipeline tables). Split the `limit=N` reads by intent: paginate the completeness-critical ones, leave the deliberate recency caps.
- Paginated via `sbFetchAll()`: `audit_log` (audit.js — full trail; order switched to `id.desc`, a monotonic bigint, so identical newest-first but stable across page boundaries; old limit=500 hid older history), safety dashboard `prestarts`+`toolbox_talks` (aggregate counts), import-reconciliation `tenders` (sks-pipeline-import.js), and pipeline board/resource `tenders`+`people` (sks-pipeline.js, sks-pipeline-resource.js). Non-unique orders got an `,id` tiebreaker for stable offset paging.
- Left as-is (deliberate caps): tender_import_runs (latest/recent-10), tender_review_decisions (only slice(0,8) shown), scoped single/multi-week schedule reads, recent-history list screens (prestarts/toolbox/diary 200, site_audits 50). No behaviour change below the old caps.

## [2026-07-10] v3.5.276 — SKS pipeline: paginate stopgap-capped table reads (SHIPPED, PR #427, live)
- Swapped `tender_enrichment`/`nominations`/`pending_schedule`/`tender_phases` reads in sks-pipeline.js + sks-pipeline-resource.js from `limit=N` stopgaps to `sbFetchAll()` (`tender_enrichment` ordered by `tender_id` — no id column). Left `tenders`/`people` (bounded by a real filter). (Concurrent session; v3.5.277/#428 later extended this to tenders/people + audit_log + safety dashboard.)

## [2026-07-10] v3.5.275 — instrument dashboard anniversaries widget (SHIPPED, PR #426, live)
- Added `dashboard_anniversaries_viewed` (fires once per distinct set of upcoming events, deduped against re-renders) and `dashboard_anniversary_person_clicked` PostHog events to the dashboard "Birthdays & Anniversaries" widget, which had zero usage instrumentation since it shipped in v3.4.16.
- Rows are now clickable through to the person's profile modal (`openPersonProfile()`, same as the roster eye icon), landing on the Acknowledgments section.
- Goal: get a real usage signal before investing further (e.g. auto-suggesting a Recognition on a work anniversary).

## [2026-07-10] v3.5.274 — paginate unbounded full-table fetches (1000-row cap fix) (SHIPPED, PR #425, live)
- Added `sbFetchAll(path, orderBy, pageSize)` to `scripts/supabase.js` (pattern ported from sks-nsw-labour v3.10.89) — pages through with an explicit `order` so a full-table read is actually full, instead of PostgREST silently truncating at its 1000-row default cap and dropping the newest (highest-id) rows.
- Swapped the 6 confirmed-unbounded `select=*` reads to it: `_loadFullDataForExport()` (schedule + timesheets) + `team_members` (index.html); `project_targets` (supabase.js); `timesheet_locks` (timesheets.js); `tender_enrichment` (order `tender_id`, no `id` PK) + `nominations` (tender-pipeline.js). `nomination_clashes` left as-is (view, no id-equivalent, absent live). No behaviour change below 1000 rows — pure headroom.

## [2026-07-09] Roster save self-heals the duplicate-key (409) race (SHIPPED, PR #423, v3.5.272, live)
- Ported from SKS NSW Labour v3.10.88. `saveCellToSB`'s POST-insert path had no handler for the `UNIQUE(name,week,org_id)` conflict fired when STATE's local cache didn't know about an existing server row (stale cache / another device wrote first); it surfaced as a misleading "Save failed — check connection". Now catches the 409, fetches the existing row, and PATCHes the edited day onto it. Identical code to SKS, `_stampPersonId` preserved. **Note:** eq-field is NOT vulnerable to the sibling v3.10.89 row-cap bug — it already windows the schedule load by week (`STATE.loadedWeeks`), never does the unbounded full-table fetch. Only the bulk-export path (`_loadFullDataForExport`, unscoped `schedule?select=*`) shares the pattern — deferred as `task_69a6ff0f`.

## [2026-07-08] v3.5.271 — SKS roster/site schema-mismatch fixes (SHIPPED, PR #422, live)
- Fix: Resource Allocation's "deployed this week" stat silently showed 0 for SKS — a `schedule_entries` query asked for wide-table-only columns (`name,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri`) that don't exist on the normalized table. Now `select=*`; the roster adapter rebuilds the wide shape. `sks-pipeline-resource.js`.
- Fix: clicking Revert on an SKS roster audit entry would 400 — same narrow-select bug on the pre-revert read. Now `select=*`. `audit.js`.
- Fix: pushing a job to the SKS roster from Resource Allocation would 400 — a `name=in.(...)` filter on `schedule_entries` has no matching column (the canonical routing shim only translates `week=`/`id=`, not `name=`). Now filters names client-side. `sks-pipeline-resource.js`.
- Fix: `/api/eq-service/sites` (EQ Quotes/Service's site-data pull from Field) was completely dead — pointed at ehow (SKS) but queried a `public.sites` table that doesn't exist there at all (every call 404'd, PGRST205). Rewired to the canonical `app_data.field_sites` adapter view via `Accept-Profile: app_data`. `eq-service-sites.js`. **Verified live:** `AUDIT_SB_KEY` is the ehow service_role key; the view returns 40 active SKS sites. Endpoint deploys clean (401 on unauthenticated smoke, not 500).
- Found, not fixed: Revert is structurally non-functional for every SKS roster edit (not just the 400 above) — `target_id` is always null because reconstructed wide week-rows have no single id to point at. Needs a design decision. See `eq/pending.md` 2026-07-08 (eq-field) entry.

## [2026-07-08] v3.5.270 — CSP: canonical Supabase host allowed in img-src (SKS logo renders)
- Fix: the SKS tenant logo (canonical branding, served from `jvknxcmbtrfnxfrwfimn.supabase.co/storage/.../tenant-logos`) was blocked by Content-Security-Policy — `img-src` never listed the canonical Supabase host, so the browser refused the image on `field.eq.solutions/?tenant=sks`. Added the specific host to `img-src` in both `netlify.toml` and `_headers` (the host was already trusted in `connect-src`; this extends it to `<img>` loads). Not a wildcard: Field's only Supabase-hosted images are canonical logos. Verified live on production. PR #421.

## [2026-07-08] v3.5.269 — People: agency is Labour-Hire-only (SKS lane v3.10.87)
- Fix: an `agency` / hire-company tag no longer lingers when someone is moved off Labour Hire. Saving a person as any other group now clears it, so a former labour-hire worker no longer still reads as labour hire (shown against them + leaking into the v3.5.268 Timesheets agency filter). Guarded at the single write path (`savePersonToSB`) so it covers both the Add-Person modal and the person wizard; the Agency field is also hidden + cleared for non-LH groups on both forms. Surfaced by Jose Quintanilla (was moved to Direct but kept "Madagins" — record cleared, EQ/canonical was already correct).

## [2026-07-08] v3.5.268 — Timesheets: filter by labour-hire agency (SKS lane v3.10.86)
- New **Agency** dropdown on the Timesheets filter bar (next to Group). Pick a labour-hire business and the list narrows to just their people — so you can print or export that agency's sheet and send it to them. Options are built from the `agency` tag on active Labour Hire workers (case-folded to merge stray case variants); the selection persists across re-renders.
- **Exports now honour the on-screen filters.** `↓ Export CSV` and `↓ Payroll Report` previously dumped everyone; both now use the filtered set (group / agency / search on eq-field; + team on SKS), and the filename gains an agency suffix (e.g. `EQ_Timesheets_06-07-26_Atom.csv`). The eq-field exports were unified onto the filtered set and now also include Direct (matching the on-screen view + SKS). Top-right Print already prints the filtered view.
- SKS data tidy: merged two look-alike agency tags — `Madigans`→`Madagins` and `core`→`Core`.

## [2026-07-08] v3.5.263→267 — Timesheets: TAFE days prefilled but editable (SKS lane v3.10.82→85)
Four iterative ships turning apprentice TAFE days from a locked cell into a prepopulated-but-editable one. Shipped to both the eq-field product (v3.5.263→267) and the standalone SKS lane (`sks-nsw-labour` v3.10.82→85).
- **v3.5.263** — the timesheet stopped muting an apprentice's TAFE day during a configured TAFE holiday, so payroll could enter real on-site hours (apprentices work through school breaks). `_tsDayStatus` made holiday-aware.
- **v3.5.264** — soft "TAFE break" hint so the unmuted holiday cell didn't look like the prefill had vanished.
- **v3.5.266** — superseded the above: **every** apprentice TAFE day renders as an editable cell pre-filled with `TAFE`/8h — looks done, counts 8h to the 40h week, reads complete untouched, but you can type a real job straight over it. Stays `workable:false` so completion logic is unchanged; the 8h count (`_tafeHrs`) is entry-aware so overwriting never double-counts.
- **v3.5.267** — the prefill is driven by each apprentice's **nominated TAFE day** (`people.tafe_day`), not just cells where a manager hand-typed TAFE — so their TAFE day prepopulates **every** week, including future weeks the roster isn't built for. Roster content still wins (rostered to a site → shows the site; on leave → mutes); the nominated-day default only fills an empty cell.

## [2026-07-08] Consistency guard vs canonical `@eq-solutions/roles` (SHIPPED, PR #418, v3.5.261, `b71fa16`, live)
- Field's own `permission-matrix.js` is Field-owned (~50 fine-grained perms) but its role keys must stay a subset of the canonical `EqRole` enum. Added a warn-only startup guard — flags a role Field invented, or a canonical role Field is missing, in the console; never throws, never changes a permission decision. Verified zero false positives against the live matrix; fires correctly on injected drift (tested both directions). `subcontractor` recorded as intentionally excluded from Field (roster `employment_type` only, never a Field login role).

## [2026-07-07] v3.5.265 — Prestart Word export back + SW resilience + iOS export (PR #420)
- **Prestart Word export re-added** (`site-reports.js exportPrestartDocx`). It was dropped when Prestart moved from `safety.js` into `site-reports.js` (same rewrite that dropped voice) — the live Prestart had NO Word export on any device. Rebuilt on the shared `SiteReportsShared.docx` builder, mirroring Toolbox: "↓ Word" button in a submitted prestart's locked footer; doc includes site/date/supervisor, prev-day issues, works scope, HRCW, SWMS refs, hazards, permits, crew sign-off (signatures), photos, tenant logo + palette. (Diary export still absent.)
- **Service worker hardened** (`sw.js`) after a stuck-loading report: precache is now per-file (`Promise.allSettled`) not atomic `addAll` — one file's 404/mobile blip can no longer wipe the whole offline cache and strand the app on a dead loader; navigation fallback serves the cached `/index.html` shell when a page request fails.
- **iOS export fallback** (`site-reports-shared.js buildPackage`): installed iOS app (standalone) silently no-ops `<a download>` — now routes the `.docx` to the Web Share sheet, else opens it. Android/desktop/iOS-Safari-tab download unchanged.

## [2026-07-07] v3.5.262 — voice-to-text back on safety-form freeform fields (PR #419)
- 🎤 dictation re-added to the FREEFORM textareas of Prestart, Toolbox and Diary (11 fields). The feature existed in the old `safety.js` forms but was lost when those were rewritten into `site-reports.js`; it had survived only on Site Audits (`audits.js`, v3.5.236).
- New shared `SiteReportsShared.voice` helper (mirrors the audits recogniser): `en-AU`, feature-detected (no mic where unsupported), one recogniser at a time, transcript **appends + stays editable**, draft syncs via the field's own `onchange`, hidden on locked/submitted forms. NOT on structured/code fields (SWMS refs, site/date).
- Needs the Shell iframe mic grant to work in core > field — see eq-shell changelog same date.

## [2026-07-07] v3.5.260 — mobile section nav unified to Lucide line icons (PR #417)
- The mobile nav mixed monochrome symbol glyphs (Home/Schedule/Roster/More) with colour emoji (`⏱` Hours, `🏖` Leave) that stuck out and never tinted on the active item. Replaced all six with inline Lucide line icons; `stroke:currentColor` greys when idle, tints navy when active.

## [2026-07-07] v3.5.259 — all modal footers clear Shell's bottom bar (PR #416)
- Generalised v3.5.258's report-modal fix to EVERY modal in shell-mode. Shell paints its persistent bottom app bar (parent window, above the iframe z-index) over the bottom ~76px, so bottom-sheet footers (Submit/Approve/Save/Done) were hidden. `@media (pointer:coarse)`: overlays bottom-pin + lift 76px, sheet capped to `calc(100dvh - 76px)`.

## [2026-07-07] v3.5.258 — Leave dashboard mobile polish + report-modal footers (PR #415)
- Leave supervisor toolbar (`.eqf-toolbar`) wraps on mobile instead of running its action buttons off the right edge; stat row 4-across → 2×2 at ≤560px; Prestart/Toolbox/Diary sticky Save/Submit footers lifted clear of Shell's bottom app bar.

## [2026-07-06] Version-stamp catch-up + tenant staff.job_title + mobile Contacts + Timesheet Batch Fill filters
- **PR #412 (MERGED, live) — version-stamp catch-up for the Calendar `isLeave` crash (Sentry EQ-FIELD-R).** The actual bug (script load-order race — `calendar.js` could execute before `roster.js`, where `isLeave()` lives) was already fixed on `main` by Royce (`d18638f`) before this PR; that fix shipped without a version bump. PR bumps `3.5.244`→`3.5.245` (APP_VERSION + sw.js CACHE + changelog banner) so the release is properly tagged and the service-worker cache busts.
- **v3.5.251 (merged, live)** — removed the dead canonical bulk-link button; auto-link-on-save (shipped just prior) already covers every case, verified 0 unlinked staff.
- **v3.5.252 (merged, live) + eq-shell PR #678 (merged, live)** — new tenant-wide `app_data.staff.job_title` column, independent of `supervisor_role`. Wired into eq-field's Contacts + wizard and eq-shell's Staff dashboard. Fixed a missing entry in `savePersonToSB`'s write whitelist that would have silently dropped the field.
- **v3.5.253 (merged, live)** — mobile Contacts "Other" bucket: an `employment_type` outside Direct/Apprentice/Labour Hire used to silently vanish from the mobile list; now shown with the raw value exposed. Found while root-causing Liam Holmgreen's stuck `is_supervisor=true` (fixed directly in the DB — three unconnected "supervisor" signals exist across eq-field/eq-shell, only `is_supervisor` is real).
- **v3.5.254 (merged, live)** — Timesheet Batch Fill: Group + Team filter dropdowns above the "Apply To" checklist, selections persist across filter switches. `teams.js` added as a `timesheets` tab prerequisite.

## [2026-07-05] docs — stale-tenant-reference audit (no version, PR #407)
- Corrected repo docs/comments that described a defunct tenant topology (verified live: canonical `organisations` = eq/sks/favour-perfect; `eq`→zaap live; `ktmj` deleted; demo-trades/melbourne gone). `CLAUDE.md` (tenant list, the inverted "ktmj is live" correction, Stack DB map, resolution wording), `DATA-PLANES-SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md` (SUPERSEDED banner), two code comments. No runtime change.

## [2026-07-05] Job-number retirement — auto (invoiced) + manual hide-only (SHIPPED, PRs #409/#410/#411, v3.5.242→244, live)
- Companion to eq-shell #669. Board rows now honour the view's auto-retire (invoiced quotes drop off by rule) and expose a canonical hide-only manual retire — a Retire button on every row incl. Ops-sourced (the one sanctioned action on an otherwise read-only row), Restore on retired rows, and a "Show retired (N)" toolbar toggle. Writes go to `public.field_job_number_overrides` via the existing data-JWT `public.*` path (no new RPC); a retired job is server-flagged `status='Retired'` so all 9 `status==='Active'` pickers (timesheets/roster/projects/tender-pipeline) exclude it automatically.
- **Live smoke caught a 403** (#410): `Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates` → `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` needs UPDATE priv authenticated lacks → switched to `ignore-duplicates` (`DO NOTHING`, INSERT-only; also correct semantics). **`retired_by` fix** (#411): was NULL (read nonexistent `STATE.me`) → now `currentManagerName` (same actor `auditLog` stamps); live-verified writing "Royce Milmlow". Full retire→restore round-trip proven in a real SKS session; Ops quote untouched throughout.

## [2026-07-04] v3.5.240 — lazy-loader: never evaluate a lazy script twice (Sentry EQ-FIELD-Q)
- **PR #406, merged + live** (verified `field.eq.solutions/sw.js` = v3.5.240). `scripts/audits.js` is the only script referenced by **two** lazy-load tab groups (`audits` + `safety`), so a double-injection re-ran its top-level `const AUDIT_SECTIONS` (+4 more `const`/`let`) → `SyntaxError: Identifier already declared`, which aborts the whole audit/safety module (the safety area is the flagged-empty Q3 gap).
- **Fix:** `lazy-loader.js loadScript` now skips injection when a `<script>` for that src is already in the DOM — not only when its in-memory `_loaded`/`_loading` maps say so — covering the map-reset / cross-instance races the maps miss. Pure guard, no normal-path behaviour change; protects every lazy script.
- **Also resolved 2 stale Sentry issues** (no code change): EQ-FIELD-P (`openCleanupCodes is not defined` — button removed v3.5.227; event was a user on a cached 3.5.223 bundle) and EQ-FIELD-N (`Unexpected end of input` — old release 3.5.221, transient, no recurrence).

## [2026-07-04] v3.5.239 — job numbers: one board, EQ Ops is the source of truth (rows 26/36)
- **PR #404, merged + live.** SKS job numbers had two drifting lists: Field's local `public.job_numbers` (14) and — separately — EQ Ops's won-quote workbench numbers (`app_data.quote.workbench_job_no`, 32 distinct). Verified live on ehow: **all 14 Field numbers already existed in Ops** — Field was a stale hand-maintained mirror. Comms (`sks_comms_jobs`) is a disjoint Microsoft-only **beta** workstream and is NOT a source (Royce's call).
- **New canonical read view `app_data.field_job_numbers`** (migration `20260704_field_job_numbers_canonical_view`, applied live to ehow) — Ops workbench numbers (source of truth) `UNION` Field-local manual numbers not on any Ops quote (dedup incl. soft-deleted, so closed jobs don't resurface). `SECURITY DEFINER` + column-limited by design: exposes job#/project/customer/site/status only, never quote financials; `authenticated` keeps no SELECT on `app_data.quote`. Live: 23 rows, all Ops-sourced, zero duplicates.
- **`scripts/supabase.js`** — `job_numbers` GET routes to the twin view (data JWT + `app_data` profile), **scoped to `TENANT.ORG_SLUG==='sks'`** (eq/zaap is also data-JWT-provisioned but has no twin → would 404). Writes stay on local `public.job_numbers` (Option A: Ops wins on overlap; manual-add preserved).
- **`scripts/jobnumbers.js`** — Ops rows render read-only with an "OPS" lock badge; mutation paths guarded by `_isOpsJob()`; CSV import replaces only Field-local manual rows and reloads the merged view.

## [2026-07-04] v3.5.236–v3.5.238 + TAFE enablement — QA sheet part 2 (rows 30/31/34/36)
- **TAFE weekly autofill ENABLED on SKS (PR #399, backend-only, no version bump)** — Row 34. The `tafe-weekly-fill` Edge Function was deployed on ehow since v3.5.216 but never switched on (no pg_cron, no `app_config` config) — so the manual "Apply TAFE Day" button was the only trigger, and it 500'd on a missing `TENANT_UUID` secret. Redeployed the function to read the tenant from `body.tenantId` (env fallback kept), set `app_config` `tafe_fn_url` + `tafe_fn_token` (**public anon key** — app_config has an anon SELECT grant so a secret there would leak; the function writes with its own service-role env, gateway `verify_jwt=false`), and scheduled the cron (Sunday 06:00 UTC = 16:00 AEST) with the tenant in the body. Dry-runs verified: fills apprentices on clear weeks, skips holiday weeks. Reversible via `cron.unschedule`.
- **v3.5.236 (PR #401)** — Row 30: voice input (🎤) on every Site Audit comment field, matching prestart/toolbox. Self-contained `_auMicBtn`/`_auSpeechToggle` in audits.js (mirrors `_auSiteDatalist`); en-AU SpeechRecognition, one recogniser at a time, hidden where unsupported or on submitted audits. Live-updates the input (no full re-render). Pure client change.
- **v3.5.237 (PR #402, concurrent session)** — Row 29: prestart auto-fills the customer from the selected site's canonical `customer_name` (blank-only). Dormant until Shell migration 0159 applies on the tenant planes.
- **v3.5.238 (PR #403)** — Row 31: prestart + toolbox photo **bytes** now persist to a private `safety-photos` Storage bucket instead of inline base64 in the row JSON (keeps rows small as usage grows). base64 stays the in-memory format so the photo grid + the .docx embed are **unchanged**; save uploads + stores `{storage_path}` (base64 stripped from the DB payload), open/export hydrates the bytes back. Bucket RLS scopes every object to the caller's own `{tenant_id}/` folder via the data-JWT claim (private, no anon). **Graceful fallback + timeout-bounded**: no data JWT / offline / RLS deny / slow network → photo stays inline base64 exactly as before and the save never hangs. Bucket + policies applied to ehow + zaap (migration `2026-07-04_safety_photos_storage.sql`). No-regression path + infra verified live; the SKS authenticated round-trip activates only with the Shell JWT (protected by the fallback).
- **Decided:** rows 26/36 (job numbers → Ops) — "Comms is very much a trial now, only worried about ops"; NO Field change (`public.job_numbers` stays local). "Ops" = the in-Shell Quotes replacement (`EqOps → QuotesNative`), not a jobs hub. Linking prompt banked (`task_1a8e00fd`).

## [2026-07-04] v3.5.234–v3.5.235 — Row 21: app_config writes 401 on SKS (leave CC list)
- **v3.5.234 (PR #398)** — `app_config` writes (leave CC list, TAFE holidays) 401'd on SKS (`42501 permission denied`): the table wasn't in `JWT_TABLES`/`JWT_INPLACE_TABLES`, so writes used the anon path where anon has SELECT-only. Two premises in the brief were wrong (verified live): (1) a **DB change WAS required** — RLS was enabled with a SELECT-only policy, so authenticated writes would still fail; (2) the eq tenant is **NOT on the anon path** — it runs the authenticated JWT twin path on zaap, so the global client change had to cover both DBs. Fix: added `app_config` to both JWT sets (client), plus governed migration `app_config_authenticated_write` applied to **both** provisioned DBs (ehow/SKS org `000…002`+tenant `7dee117c…`; zaap/EQ org `a0000000-…-001`+tenant `dcb71d03…`) — authenticated `ALL` policy scoped by org_id + JWT `app_metadata.tenant_id` (acknowledgments/audit_log template), `org_id` column DEFAULT for inserts, service_role parity. RLS-verified on both DBs (correct-tenant writes pass, wrong-tenant blocked, anon gate reads intact). demo-trades/melbourne (anon-only seed orgs in zaap) unaffected.
- **v3.5.235 (PR #400)** — Follow-up: with writes now persisting, the leave CC panel could still show empty because `openLeaveCCConfig()` rendered the in-memory list without re-reading. `loadLeaveCCList()` runs once at `initApp`, so a row written after that (first save this session) or edited by another supervisor showed a stale/empty modal even though the DB was correct. `openLeaveCCConfig()` now re-reads `app_config` on every open and re-renders. Pure client change.

## [2026-07-04] v3.5.225–v3.5.233 — QA sheet (EQ Field 4.7.26.xlsx): all 35 rows worked through
- **v3.5.225 (PR #389)** — Prestart .docx rebuilt to match the SKS template exactly (12 sections); logo + palette + "<TENANT> DAILY PRE-START" title all canonical-driven. Form now captures every section (project#, affects-trades, Controls repeater, 8 tickable Measures Yes/No/NA, Other-Hazards repeater, Permit checkboxes). +6 nullable columns on `public.prestarts` on **ehow AND zaap** (project_number, affects_trades, controls, other_hazards, permits_selected, measures). Row 32.
- **v3.5.226 (PR #390)** — Middle-name approver linking: canonical full legal names never matched the first+last staff index, so leave approvals silently unlinked. `leave-adapter.js nameToStaffId` now indexes + looks up a middle-dropped form both directions (covers leave/timesheets/roster). Rows 7/10/14.
- **v3.5.227 (PR #390)** — Removed 3 redundant buttons: Contacts "⬆ Canonical", Sites "🧹 Clean Up Codes" (also kills the `openCleanupCodes is not defined` console error), Edit-Roster "🖨 Weekly Site Report". Rows 16/17/33.
- **v3.5.228 (PR #391)** — Leave "← Back to Leave" bar on the View-All-Requests list; Contacts now excludes anyone in the Supervision list (email-then-name match) via shared `_peopleExMgrs`/`_contactsCount` in utils.js (always-loaded; badge runs at boot before people.js). Rows 22/11.
- **v3.5.229 (PR #392)** — Labour-hire "DID NOT WORK" pill fills Mon–Fri with `DNW` (added to the **spans renderer** — the 5-col table in timesheets.js is dead-code fallback); Add Person/Contact hidden on SKS via `body.tenant-sks .js-add-person`. Rows 24/37.
- **v3.5.230 (PR #393)** — Supervisor-only "✏ Edit Roster" button bridges the read-only Weekly Roster to the editor. Row 19.
- **v3.5.231 (PR #394)** — Middle-name display sweep across the remaining surfaces (timesheet name col, Contacts card+table, Leave list/table + CC chips); display-only, data keeps full name. Rows 7/14.
- **v3.5.232 (PR #395)** — Site Audit "Project/Site" field is now a canonical site dropdown + free-type (self-contained `_auSiteDatalist`), matching prestart/toolbox. Row 27.
- **v3.5.233 (PR #396)** — Prestart "↺ Use last for <SITE>" fills standing setup (contractor/project#/SWMS/HRCW/Controls/Hazards/Permits) from the most recent prestart at the selected site; not per-day content or crew. Row 28.
- Deferred: Row 29 (auto-fill customer from site — needs the customer name in the Shell-owned `field_sites` view); Row 21 sub-bug (`app_config` writes 401 on SKS — anon lacks UPDATE; route via authenticated JWT, spawned `task_9942e427`); Row 30 (audit talk-to-text). Resolved by verification: row 4 (one "From Roster" button), row 8 (person-wizard moot on SKS now Add Person is hidden), row 23 (spans renderer already preserves scroll). Deliverable: annotated `EQ Field 4.7.26 - outcomes.xlsx`.

## [2026-07-04] Closed a cross-tenant leak in `app_data.field_job_numbers` (SHIPPED, PR #405 + `20260704b_field_job_numbers_invoker_over_secdef.sql` applied to ehow, live)
- The view was a SECURITY DEFINER view readable by `authenticated`, exposing SKS `quote`/customer/site data to any authed user. Fix moves the definer read into `app_data.field_job_numbers_src()` (SECDEF fn returning only 11 safe columns — job#/project/customer/site/status, never financials; EXECUTE authed+service_role, revoked from PUBLIC) and makes the view `security_invoker=true` over it. Byte-identical browser read (23 rows). Context: a naive `revoke authenticated` (from the eq-shell drift-gate unblock) had broken this board live; this is the correct fix. `field_job_numbers` was originally created out-of-band (not via a repo migration) — provenance tracked as `task_0467f68c`.

## [2026-07-04] Retired-Quotes CORS origins removed + zaap prestart column rename
- Removed both retired-Quotes origins (`quotes.eq.solutions`, `eq-quotes-sks.fly.dev`) from `netlify/functions/eq-service-sites.js` `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` after Royce deleted the Fly.io account hosting the Quotes app. Default CORS fallback is now `localhost:5000` (fail-closed). PR #397 squash-merged (`87d2e09`) + auto-deployed to field.eq.solutions (`ready`).
- **zaap `prestarts.sks_rep` → `site_rep`** — the eq demo tenant DB still had the pre-v3.5.220 column name, so prestart saves on `?tenant=eq` kept 400ing even after the client fix (PR #384) landed for ehow/SKS. Renamed via migration `rename_prestarts_sks_rep_to_site_rep` (no dependent views/triggers/functions — only a `deny_all` policy; verified with a rolled-back insert+select round-trip). zaap-only; ehow/SKS was already correct. DB-only change, no code/deploy.

## [2026-07-04] Roster cell popover was fully dead — rebuilt (SHIPPED, PR #386, live)
- Pill remove, Clear button, site search/select was built on `innerHTML` + inline `onclick=""` string construction, which silently no-ops on this page. Rewritten with `document.createElement`/`appendChild`/`addEventListener` throughout. Found during a pre-pass bug sweep ahead of Royce's planned week of personally stress-testing Roster/Timesheets/Leave.

## [2026-07-03] v3.5.218–v3.5.222 — SKS QA batch: leave/timesheets/roster/safety fixes
- **v3.5.218 (PR #382)** — leave submit's real error now logged (console + Sentry) instead of a generic toast; person names in Roster/Editor/mobile/batch-fill display "First Last" only (new `shortName()` helper, display-only); removed a duplicate static "Pre-fill from Roster" button on Timesheets.
- **v3.5.219 (PR #383)** — Timesheets "Weekends" toggle now actually shows Sat/Sun columns (was wired to a table renderer superseded by the live "spans" renderer, which never read the toggle at all); Roster no longer shows "(unknown)" staff names on cold boot (staff-map load-order race — `loadCanonicalStaffMap()` moved ahead of the schedule fetch in `loadFromSupabase()`).
- **v3.5.220–221 (PR #384)** — Prestarts: `sks_rep`→`site_rep` client column typo fixed (every prestart save had been failing with PGRST204). Toolbox Talks: migration `toolbox_talks_add_missing_form_columns` applied to ehow — 4 real form fields (Key safety message, Hazards discussed, SWMS references, Next meeting) had no matching DB columns. Site Audits audited, already correct. Leave: pre-check staff_id resolvability before the network call so the specific "no matching staff record" toast survives instead of being overwritten.
- **v3.5.222 (PR #385)** — `showPage()`'s error handling split: a failed lazy-load script vs. a thrown render exception were previously conflated under one misleading label with a blind retry; now reported distinctly via console + Sentry.
- **eq-shell PR #619** (separate repo) — `FieldIframe.tsx`'s tenant auto-select was clearing a deep-linked `?tab=` param before first use; `?tab=person-wizard` and similar deep links now correctly hold instead of falling back to Dashboard.
- Known open issue: person-wizard still renders blank content on a cold `?tab=person-wizard` deep link specifically (works via normal in-app navigation) — root cause not yet found, see `sks/pending.md` 2026-07-03 block.

## [2026-07-02] Schedule page 404 for SKS tenant fixed (`2c374cb`)
- Canonical roster reads (`roster-adapter.js` `rewriteReadPath`) hit nonexistent `app_data.schedule` instead of `app_data.schedule_entries`; writes were already correct.

## [2026-07-01] v3.5.216–v3.5.217 — Canonical edge fn rewrite + URL-per-tab Field side
- **v3.5.216 (PR #380)** — 4 Supabase edge functions rewritten for `app_data.*` canonical schema (ehow compatibility): `supervisor-digest`, `ts-reminder`, `tafe-weekly-fill`, `shift-events`. All 4 deployed to ehow for the first time (were not previously deployed there). `ts_reminders_sent` table created on ehow.
- **v3.5.217 (PR #381)** — URL-per-tab Field side: `showPage()` emits `{ type: 'EQ_TAB_CHANGE', tab: <slug> }` postMessage to Shell on every tab switch; `initApp()` reads `?tab=` from the iframe src and activates the named tab after role routing. Feature is inert until the Shell-side PR lands.

## [2026-06-30] Security — zaap worker-PII anon-grant revoke (no version bump — DB migration)
- **PR #379** (`18b17b8`) — defense-in-depth on the Field data plane (`zaapmfdkgedqupfjtchl`, eq-canonical-internal). `REVOKE ALL FROM anon` on `public.workers`, `worker_credentials`, `worker_inductions`, `worker_assignments`. Migration `supabase/migrations/20260630_zaap_worker_cluster_anon_revoke.sql`, applied live via Supabase MCP (`zaap_worker_cluster_anon_revoke`). DB-only, no app version bump.
- These tables already had RLS on with `auth.uid()`-scoped owner policies (anon got 0 rows; all empty) — the anon GRANT was latent risk only. Now closed-by-default at the privilege layer. `authenticated` (worker self-service) + `service_role` retained; RLS/policies untouched. Verified anon→permission-denied post-apply. eq-shell drift baseline unchanged (tables were never anon-reachable per the drift checker).

## [2026-06-30] v3.5.212 — audit_log: org_id stamp + manager_name fix
- **verify-pin.js** `logAttempt()`: stamps `org_id: TENANT_ORG_UUID` in the POST body. `org_id` is NOT NULL on `audit_log` — the missing field caused every auth sign-in row to 401 silently and be dropped. Guard: skipped when `TENANT_ORG_UUID` is null (fallback deployments keep working).
- **eq-agent.js** `logAgentCall()`: same `org_id` fix. Also renames wrong column `who` → `manager_name` (`audit_log` schema uses `manager_name` throughout — the mismatch caused agent-call rows to also drop). Added `TENANT_ORG_UUID` env var read.

## [2026-06-30] v3.5.207 → v3.5.211 — Canonical wiring sprint (Roster/Teams/Safety/Apprentices/cleanup)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code
**Sprint covered:** 2026-06-30 (full day, continuation of v3.5.199–206 wiring execution)

- **v3.5.207** — Roster/Leave realtime + Teams canonical wire + worker_id column cleanup. `field_teams`/`field_team_members` views created on ehow (org_id RLS, INSTEAD OF triggers). Realtime publication populated (schedule_entries + leave_requests). `realtime.js` subscribes by canonical base-table name.
- **v3.5.208** — Safety module fully wired for SKS. `prestarts`/`toolbox_talks`/`site_diaries`/`site_audits`/`site_audit_items` granted authenticated CRUD; `site_audits`+`site_audit_items` created on ehow; JWT_INPLACE routing wired; BEFORE INSERT trigger fills tenant_id on the 3 public.* safety tables.
- **v3.5.209** — JWT routing gaps fixed. Bucket-B tables (`job_numbers`, `regions`, `projects`, `project_targets`, `roster_presence`) restored to JWT_TABLES (v3.5.195 regression). `tender_phases`/`nomination_clashes` added; `GRANT SELECT ON nomination_clashes TO authenticated`.
- **v3.5.210** — Apprentice cluster fully wired. 7 new `public.*` tables on ehow (`competencies`, `skills_ratings`, `feedback_entries`, `feedback_requests`, `rotations`, `quarterly_reviews`, `apprentice_journal`); `apprentice_profiles` granted + org_id RLS; 6 electrical competencies seeded; two direct anon-fetch calls in `apprentices.js` replaced with sbFetch.
- **v3.5.211** — Canonical cleanup. `public.pending_schedule` created on ehow (Tender Pipeline Push-to-Roster staging table). `field_schedule`/`field_timesheets`/`field_leave_requests` converted to SECURITY INVOKER (DEFINER with no role grants was silently blocking Roster/Timesheets/Leave). Data tab gated off for SKS (nav-data + ditem-data hidden — import/restore would overwrite canonical data). Dead `worker_id` mirror PATCH removed; `roster_presence` removed from ORG_TABLES.

**Action required (Royce):** update `AUDIT_SB_KEY` in Netlify eq-solves-field to the ehow service_role key so auth audit rows land in `audit_log`.

## [2026-06-30] field_sites honours `active` (archived sites retire from Field)
- `app_data.field_sites` view tightened to `WHERE field_enabled = true AND active = true` (was `field_enabled` only). An archived site (active=false) now drops out of EQ Field even if field_enabled is still true. Applied live to ehow; migration `20260630_field_sites_filter_active.sql` merged via PR #367. Zero rows affected at apply time. Mirror fix for `service.sites` also done (eq-service migration 0163).

## [2026-06-30] v3.5.199 → v3.5.206 — Overnight security audit + canonical-wiring execution
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code
**Security (migrations on ehow):**
- Closed CRITICAL anon read/write/DELETE on live `public.tenders` (366 rows) + the tender cluster — Option A canonical-org (`000…002`) scoping, anon torn down, authenticated CRUD. `field_people` definer→invoker; `job_numbers` hardened; stale `20260618_acknowledgments.sql` neutralised.
- **SKS = Core-only auth** (v3.5.200): standalone PIN gate + whole PIN subsystem retired for SKS.
**Incident fix (v3.5.201–202):** SKS Contacts/roster blanked — `window.TENANT` was never exposed so the canonical adapters couldn't detect the tenant → schedule reads 400 → boot cascade. Fixed (expose `window.TENANT`, adapter allow-list authoritative, per-fetch load resilience).
**Canonical wiring (from the 12-feature audit):**
- v3.5.203 — **#1 unlock:** authenticated CRUD granted on `app_data.schedule_entries/timesheets/leave_requests` (+ `hours_planned` DEFAULT 0) → Roster/Timesheets/Leave write-capable. Job Numbers dead-call fix.
- v3.5.204 — Tender Pipeline enrichment/nominations/phases writes unblocked (`tender_enrichment` hardened + `ORG_TABLES` stamping).
- v3.5.205 — Presence + Supervisor Notes retired for SKS (dead/absent surfaces).
- v3.5.206 — Managers + Sites read-only for SKS (Shell-owned; write entry points gated).
- Digest opt-out (DB migration, no version bump): `field_managers.digest_opt_in` writable via a digest-only INSTEAD OF trigger; 19 supervisors backfilled opted-in.
**Deferred:** Teams wire, Safety grants + create `site_audits`, Apprentices cluster, realtime publication, `user_id` backfill (see `eq/pending.md`).

## [2026-06-27] on_roster now filters the roster grid (PR #349, merged)
- The eq-field roster grid + timesheets now honour `app_data.staff.on_roster`, hiding off-roster people (office/managers) from the roster while keeping them in Contacts. Later superseded/extended by v3.5.301 (#454, 2026-07-11), which added the full Roster + Timesheets + completion-stats hide keyed on the same flag.

## [2026-06-26] v3.5.191 — Safety docs: footer parity (page numbers + EQ Solves credit)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code
**Changes:**
- Footer across all safety `.docx` exports (Prestart / Toolbox / Site Audit) now renders `<label>  |  Page N of M  |  Generated by EQ Solves — Field` using live Word PAGE/NUMPAGES fields (not static text).
- Centralised footer assembly in `buildPackage(opts)` via `opts.footerLabel`; callers (`safety.js`, `audits.js`, `toolbox.js`) pass the document type label. `opts.footerText` kept as a backward-compat alias.
- Helper fns `_fRPr` / `_fRun()` / `_fField()` isolate font/size/colour from the field structs — Arial 7pt #AAAAAA, consistent across all templates.
**Status:** Live on field.eq.solutions (PR #345, merge `673f94f`)

---

## [2026-06-25] v3.5.190 — Safety docs: tenant brand palette (SKS navy)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code
**Changes:**
- Prestart/Toolbox/Audit `.docx` exports colour from canonical `organisations.branding.palette` ({primary,deep,ice,ink}) instead of hardcoded EQ blue; SKS = navy, tenants without a palette fall back to EQ blue. Read-only consume.
- Shared builder: validated `setPalette()` + `_hex()` + `declaration()` helper + fail-fast guard (`buildPackage` throws if unprimed, commit `7efec20`). Seeded canonical palette for `sks` (navy) + `eq` (blue).
- Suite brand-palette write-path consolidation (Shell/Service) DEFERRED to 2nd-tenant onboard (design banked, shape B).
**Status:** Live on field.eq.solutions (PR #342, merge `c29b292`)

## [2026-06-18] v3.5.163 — Apprentices: fix year level pre-fill on setup (PR #305, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

`openSetupProfile` was hardcoding year level to `'1'` before the person lookup. Added one line to read `person.year_level` from STATE.people after the lookup — modal now opens pre-filled to match the contacts card.

## [2026-06-18] v3.5.162 — Apprentices: SKS tenant unlock (PR #304, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

- 11 apprentice tables created in SKS tenant DB (ehowgjardagevnrluult): `apprentice_profiles`, `apprentice_journal`, `skills_ratings`, `competencies`, `feedback_entries`, `feedback_requests`, `rotations`, `buddy_checkins`, `quarterly_reviews`, `engagement_log`, `checkins`
- `person_id`/`supervisor_id`/`buddy_id` in `apprentice_profiles` adapted to `bigint` (SKS `people.id` = bigint, unlike EQ uuid)
- 11 standard electrical competencies seeded
- `module_entitlements` flipped to `enabled=true` in jvkn for all 11 apprentice modules on SKS org
- GRANT SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on all tables to anon role (captured in migration `grant_apprentice_tables_to_anon`)
- Nav: removed `nav-apprentices` + `ditem-apprentices` from SKS hide list

**Human Recognition context:** Apprentice module is the first full expression of the EQ recognition philosophy — journal (private by default, apprentice-owned), peer acknowledgments, skills growth tracking, feedback on apprentice's terms. Worker-first design verified before SKS unlock.

## [2026-06-18] v3.5.161 — Nav: Safety group + hide PIN Management (PR #303, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

- Site Audits, Safety (Prestarts/Toolbox), and Safety Report collapsed into collapsible "Safety ▾" group. Auto-expands for SKS tenant.
- PIN Management hidden (`nav-pins`) — individual worker PIN feature is orphaned without the labour hire login tier.

## [2026-06-15] v3.5.148 — SKS Field showed nothing: stale JWT_INPLACE_TENANTS routing (PR #289, merged)
- SKS Field loaded no data because `JWT_INPLACE_TENANTS={'sks'}` was stale — it routed SKS reads to `public.*` on ehow (0 SKS rows, no `authenticated` grant) instead of the canonical `app_data.field_*` twin path where the data lives. Removed `'sks'` (verified live bundle = `new Set([])`). Console 403s had confirmed the data-JWT mints fine (`role=authenticated`) — it was just pointed at the wrong tables.
- Also restored the `app_data.field_people` SELECT grant on ehow (lost when the view was recreated for the new `on_roster` column) and set apprentice `year_level`. Live result: EQ Field staff 0 → 67 (48 Direct / 11 Apprentice / 8 Labour Hire), 171 licences intact.

## [2026-06-15] v3.5.147 — Canonical worker write (PR #288, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

Extends v3.5.146: `_canonicalWorkerUpsert()` creates a stub in jvkn.workers (first_name, last_name, email, phone, role) when no canonical worker exists for the email. SELECT-first prevents duplicates. `syncAllToCanonical()` bulk supervisor action seeds all unlinked people at once. Fire-and-forget throughout — canonical failures never block UI. Deployed 2026-06-15T02:38Z.

**Note:** Stub creation from Field is transition scaffolding. Target architecture has Cards/Shell as the sole creator of jvkn.workers rows. Remove create-path when Cards onboarding is live.

---

## [2026-06-15] v3.5.146 — Canonical worker-link bridge (PR #287, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

Phase 2 canonical wiring. `_tryLinkPersonToWorker()` fires on every person save: looks up jvkn.workers by email, patches `people.worker_id` if found. Signature extended to pass name/phone/group. Three call sites wired (modal save, wizard new, wizard edit). Fire-and-forget.

## [2026-06-13] v3.5.139 — CSP `_headers` sync + Sentry T3 scrubbing (PR #277, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

Sync `_headers` CSP with `netlify.toml` (wildcards, wss://, api.anthropic.com, c.bing.com, R2 img-src, worker-src). Add T3 secret scrubbing in `netlify/functions/_shared/sentry.js` — `EQ_SECRET_SALT`, `AUDIT_SB_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` replaced with `[T3:SCRUBBED]` in Sentry error payloads to prevent secret leakage through error reporting. Production commit `068920b`, deployed 2026-06-13T03:16:59Z.

## [2026-06-13] eq-shell fix — EQ Service iframe loading (PR #334, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

No EQ Field version bump — change is in eq-shell. EQ Service (`core.eq.solutions/sks/service`) was showing "Loading EQ Service…" indefinitely. Root cause: `ServiceIframe.tsx` fallback timer was 12s with a stale OTP comment; TOKEN MODE handshake completes in ~2-3s. Fixed: 12s → 4s + Sentry breadcrumbs. PR #334 merged + deployed 2026-06-13T00:44:57Z.

---

## [2026-06-11] v3.5.125 — SKS canonical DB: full JWT coverage + RLS hardening (PR #267, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

SKS Field (`core.eq.solutions/sks/field`) was showing all zeros + permanent loading spinners after the v3.5.120 greenfield cut-over to ehow. Root cause: 7 of 11 `app_data.field_*` views were missing → PGRST205 on every data load.

**DB changes (applied to ehow `ehowgjardagevnrluult`):**
- Created `public.organisations` stub (eliminates 404 boot noise)
- Created `public.site_diaries` table (completes `JWT_TABLES` coverage)
- Created 7 missing `app_data.field_*` views (pass-through, writable)
- Hardened RLS WITH CHECK on all 14 write policies (org_id + authenticated + JWT tenant claim)
- Fixed `audit_log` RLS policies (nspb UUID → correct SKS org_id; SELECT scoped)
- Cleared 109 legacy audit_log rows (clean slate)

**Migration:** `supabase/migrations/20260611_sks_canonical_field_sync.sql` (idempotent)

**Result:** SKS Field dashboard loads. Staff (58) + sites (591) via adapter views. Roster empty — start fresh.

**PR:** [#267](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/267) — merged, live.

## [2026-06-09] v3.5.119 — v8 navy → ink/sky token cleanup — JS stragglers (PR #260, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

Swept all remaining `color:var(--navy)` bare inline styles across five JS files that the v3.5.116 v8 CSS pass hadn't touched. Text heading contexts → `var(--ink,var(--navy))`; dollar/stat accent contexts → `var(--sky,var(--navy))`. Backward-compatible fallback pattern throughout (old `--navy` token still resolves on any deploy that hasn't loaded `field-v8.css`).

Files changed: `scripts/apprentices.js` (19), `scripts/auth.js` (1), `scripts/audit.js` (2), `scripts/teams.js` (2), `scripts/sks-pipeline.js` (9 — split treatment). No schema/auth changes.

**PR:** [#260](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/260) — merged, live.

## [2026-06-08] v3.5.100 — Sentry EQ-FIELD-5: complete dashboard lazy-load guard (PR #230, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

`siteColor()`, `getSiteName()`, and `isAbsence()` all live in lazy-loaded `roster.js`
but are called from core-loaded `dashboard.js` before `roster.js` loads. Added inline
fallbacks for all three using eagerly-loaded `app-state.js` constants (SITE_COLOR_MAP,
EDUCATION_TERMS, LEAVE_TERMS, STATE.sites). Fixes Sentry EQ-FIELD-5 (`siteColor is not
defined`, seen via `field.sks.eq.solutions`). Pre-empts the next two crashes in the same
render path. Combined with v3.5.99, fully closes the dashboard lazy-load race for all
`roster.js` dependants. No schema/data/auth changes.

**PR:** [#230](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/230) — merged, live.

---

## [2026-06-07] v3.5.99 — Sentry EQ-FIELD-3 + EQ-FIELD-4: lazy-load ReferenceErrors (PR #227, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**EQ-FIELD-3** `isLeave is not defined` (dashboard.js:77, 15 events, escalating): dashboard
site-count loop called `isLeave()` from lazy-loaded `roster.js` before it loaded. Added
`_isLeave` inline fallback using `LEAVE_TERMS` from `app-state.js` (same pattern as v3.5.84
`updateTopStats` guard).

**EQ-FIELD-4** `auditLog is not defined` (timesheets.js:419): `auditLog()` called unguarded
from 14+ modules; `audit.js` was lazy (Audit tab only). `audit.js` (233 lines) moved to
core-loaded scripts in `index.html`; removed from `TAB_SCRIPTS` to prevent duplicate `let`
redeclare crash. Kills the entire class of auditLog crashes. No schema/data/auth changes.

**PR:** [#227](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/227) — merged, live.

## [2026-06-06] v3.5.86 — Fix team delete (FK violation) (PR #203, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** Deleting a team on SKS failed ("Could not delete team"). `deleteTeam` (`scripts/teams.js`) deleted the `teams` row directly, relying on an `ON DELETE CASCADE` that the SKS `team_members → teams` FK doesn't have → foreign-key violation on any team with members (all 6 SKS teams). **Fix:** delete the `team_members` links first, then the team (robust regardless of the FK; people rows untouched). Live-verified `field.sks.eq.solutions/sw.js` = v3.5.86.

## [2026-06-06] v3.5.85 — SSO supervisor mapping (cookie path) + Teams org_id stamping (PR #202, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** Two pre-go-live fixes. (1) **Auth** — `verify-pin.js` `verify-shell-cookie` now grants Field `supervisor` to platform admins (parity with `verify-shell-token`); previously the cookie SSO path ignored `is_platform_admin`, so an admin whose tenant-membership role wasn't manager/supervisor landed in **view-only** on the `core.eq.solutions` front door. (2) **Teams** — `teams` + `team_members` added to `ORG_TABLES` (both `org_id NOT NULL`, no default) so `sbFetch` stamps `org_id` on POST; without it, team/member creates 400'd on SKS.

**Companion live DB hardening (same pass, not app versions):**
- **SKS prod `nspbmi`:** added nullable `people.employment_type/rto/hire_company` + `sites.project_id` (EQ Field writes them; SKS lacked them → person/site edits 400'd + silently dropped on the dual-write soak).
- **SKS-canonical `ehow`:** `eq_check/increment_intake_rate_limit` DEFINER fns — pinned `search_path` + revoked EXECUTE from public/anon/authenticated (sole caller = api-intake edge fn on service_role); they had trusted a caller-supplied `p_tenant_id`.
- **Control-plane drift (earlier same day):** `app_data.eq_intake_rate_limits` RLS gate `user_metadata`→`app_metadata` on `ehow` (unblocked eq-shell schema-drift CI).
- Audited safe: 17/19 ehow DEFINER RPCs JWT-scoped; the 4 anon control-plane Cards DEFINER fns are auth.uid()/token-gated.

## [2026-06-06] v3.5.84 — Boot-crash guard: updateTopStats isLeave ReferenceError
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** `updateTopStats()` (called from `initApp()` on every boot) referenced an undefined `isLeave`, throwing a `ReferenceError` on the EQ tenant at boot. Guarded/fixed so boot stats compute clean.

## [2026-06-06] v3.5.83 — Data carrier: anon fallback fixes SKS gate lock-out on EQ Field (PR #199, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** Fixed the cutover blocker where the **SKS tenant on the EQ Field build** (`field.sks.eq.solutions`) showed an **empty "who are you" gate** — nobody could log in. The gate's pre-login name fetch (`sbFetch('people'/'managers')`) hits `JWT_TABLES`, so the carrier tried to mint a data-JWT; pre-auth there's no session → it threw → empty list → lock-out.

**Fix (`scripts/supabase.js`):** `sbFetch` now **falls back to the anon path** when the data-JWT can't be minted (no-session / disabled / tenant-not-provisioned) instead of throwing; `_getDataJwt` latches *stable* failures but never `no-session`, so the JWT path still activates the moment a session exists. Post-login the authed path is unchanged.

**Verified live:** gate now lists **69 SKS names**; `DATA_JWT_ENABLED` is **on**, so post-login SKS reads its own data via the STEP-1 in-place authed policies. Also fixed `melbourne`/`demo-trades` (not in `DATA_TENANT_IDS`) throwing on the JWT path. EQ demo tenants unaffected (SEED gate).

**PR:** [#199](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/199) — **merged**, live (prod sw.js = `eq-field-v3.5.83`).

## [2026-06-06] v3.5.82 — SKS pipeline → authenticated JWT + RLS (B5 Track 2, staged dormant) (PR #195, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** Generalised the dormant PIN→Supabase-JWT carrier so the **SKS** tenant can be secured **in-place** (on SKS's own Supabase `nspbmirochztcjijmcrx`) rather than via the canonical `app_data.field_*` twins EQ uses (zaap twins are empty; SKS data is live in its own project). Ships **DORMANT behind `DATA_JWT_ENABLED` (off)** — code is live on eq-solves-field but inert; EQ stays twin-mode, behaviour unchanged.

- **verify-pin.js** — single `ZAAP_JWT_SECRET` replaced by a per-tenant secret resolver (`eq`→`ZAAP_JWT_SECRET`, `sks`→`SKS_JWT_SECRET`, extensible via `TENANT_JWT_SECRETS_JSON`). `signSupabaseJwt()` takes the resolved secret; `DATA_TENANT_IDS` gains `sks → 1eb831f9-…` (= `org_id` on SKS rows).
- **supabase.js** — JWT table rewrite + `app_data` profile header now conditional on `JWT_INPLACE_TENANTS = {sks}`: in-place tenants keep `public.<name>` on their own project + minted JWT; twin tenants unchanged. RPC path guarded.
- **realtime.js** — in-place tenants stream `realtime:public:<table>` (socket already JWT-authed since v3.5.64).

**RLS migration AUTHORED, NOT applied:** `migrations/2026-06-06_sks_pipeline_rls.sql` — `authenticated`-role + tenant isolation (`org_id = jwt app_metadata.tenant_id`; `nominations`/`tender_enrichment` via parent `tender_id → tenders.org_id`), `nominations` supervisor-vs-`confirmed` visibility (the `person_id::text = sub` clause is text-safe + inert under shared-PIN auth), anon revoked on carrier tables, `audit_log` carve-out keeps a narrowed anon INSERT for verify-pin's server logger. Narrows the `rls_policy_always_true` advisor WARNs.

**⚠ Still gated on Royce (SKS LIVE):** apply the migration + add `SKS_JWT_SECRET` to the SKS Netlify site + flip `DATA_JWT_ENABLED=on` — each needs a snapshot + per-action OK. Merging only landed dormant code; nothing touched SKS.

**Live-system note (recon):** the Tender Pipeline IS already promoted to SKS live + populated (CLAUDE.md's "not yet promoted" TODO is stale). SKS carrier tables key on `org_id`, not `tenant_id`. Canonical `organisations.hostname` for `sks` was also repointed to `sks-field.netlify.app` this session so EQ Field resolves SKS at the new host.

**PR:** [#195](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/195) — **merged**, live (prod sw.js = `eq-field-v3.5.82`). Rebumped 3.5.80→3.5.82 (3.5.81 taken by #196).

---

## [2026-06-06] v3.5.81 — Teams: id-type fix for uuid tenants (PR #196, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** `scripts/teams.js` was numeric-id-native, so the whole Teams feature broke on uuid-id tenants (EQ / melbourne / demo-trades): filter pills emitted unquoted uuid ids into `setTeamFilter(...)` (invalid JS), and Manage-Teams member checkboxes used `Number(uuid)=NaN`, so no member could be added. All team/person ids now coerce to strings via a `_sid()` helper before any compare, and onclick handler ids are quoted — works on bigint (SKS) AND uuid tenants; SKS unchanged.

**PR:** [#196](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/196) — **merged**, live. (A parallel duplicate, #197, was closed in favour of this one.)

---

## [2026-06-05] v3.5.74 — Job number per roster assignment (menu + pin) (PR #187, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code
Multi-job sites. In Edit Roster, a cell whose site carries >1 job number shows a per-day job pick-list; the supervisor pins which job that person is on. The pin shows under the site code on the roster grid and as "🔢 Job …" on My Schedule, **overriding** the project primary for that cell. Single-/no-job sites unchanged (primary auto-shows, no picker); leave cells none. Resolution per cell: pin (`schedule.{day}_job`) > project primary (v3.5.73) > none. Stores the plain job **number string** — the value direct workers carry into Workbench. **LH/apprentice timesheet auto-fill from the pin deliberately deferred** (next step). DB: `schedule.mon_job…sun_job` (nullable text) on **ktmj.public.schedule** (live) + forward-compat zaap twins. Realtime propagates pins. PR [#187](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/187) — **merged**, prod sw.js = `eq-field-v3.5.74`.

## [2026-06-05] v3.5.73 — Job numbers on the weekly schedule (PR #186, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code
Roster grid + My Schedule show a project's job number under each site assignment. **Derived, not entered:** a project links to one row in the Job Numbers list (Projects → edit → "Job Number"), inherited by every site in the project. No `schedule`-table change, no per-cell entry; loose free-text reminder cells untouched. DB: `projects.job_number_id` (nullable, no FK) on **ktmjmdzqrogauaevbktn.public.projects** (the LIVE EQ plane — NOT zaap) + forward-compat zaap twins. PR [#186](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/186) — **merged**, prod sw.js = `eq-field-v3.5.73`.

**Operating model (captured this session):** the Weekly Roster is the single surface every worker reads. Direct staff book hours in **Workbench**; Field timesheets are a tracking/reconciliation surface (execs reconcile Field vs Workbench). Labour-hire & apprentices are entered into Field timesheets for **invoice reconciliation by accounts**. So the roster job number is the *communicated truth* direct workers carry into Workbench.

> **⚠ Data-plane correction (live > docs):** `ktmjmdzqrogauaevbktn` is still the live EQ read/write plane (12 projects / 48 sites / 11 job_numbers / 605 people / 2417 schedule rows). The zaap `app_data.field_*` twins are **empty**, so the JWT routing in `supabase.js` isn't serving EQ data at runtime — reads/writes hit `public.*` via anon. Any EQ schema change must target **ktmj.public.\*** or `saveX-to-SB` 400s on deploy. This contradicts the Phase-2 "secured on JWT" wording; reconcile before acting on it. **Do NOT pause/downgrade `ktmjmdzqrogauaevbktn`** (a carried-forward `pending.md` action) — it would take EQ Field down.

## [2026-06-04] v3.5.72 — Remove the "Pick a demo tenant" workspace picker (PR #185, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** A plain load of eq-solves-field.netlify.app no longer shows the v3.5.18 "Pick a demo tenant" overlay — it boots straight into EQ Field (the default `eq` tenant resolved by `_detectTenantSlug` on the Field host). EQ Field is the front door for tenants now; the tiered demo chooser is gone. Removed the `tenant-picker-overlay` HTML + boot IIFE (index.html) and the `#tenant-picker-overlay` / `.tpo-*` CSS (styles/base.css). Nothing read `__EQ_TENANT_PICKER_ACTIVE__`.

**No loss of reach:** the Advanced/Enterprise demo tenants are still reachable on demand via `?tenant=demo-trades` / `?tenant=melbourne`; the `#sh=` shell handoff is unchanged. Enterprise surface to be built out later.

**Note:** this changelog had drifted — v3.5.60–v3.5.71 shipped without entries here (the in-HTML banner in index.html is the canonical changelog for v3.5+). This entry resumes the log at v3.5.72.

**PR:** [#185](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/185) — **merged**, live (prod sw.js = `eq-field-v3.5.72`).

## Catch-up — v3.5.66–v3.5.71 (compact; in-HTML banner is canonical)

> These six releases shipped without per-version entries here. The canonical,
> full-detail changelog for v3.5+ is the in-HTML banner at the top of `index.html`
> in eq-field. One line each below for narrative continuity:

- **v3.5.71** — Mobile: Staff-home "Team week" read-only crew view + "Who's with me"; My Schedule day cards list the site crew. Ported from SKS v3.10.55. (PR #184)
- **v3.5.70** — Timesheets: education codes (TAFE/TRAINING) only mute the sheet for apprentices, not direct employees; in-place row-stripe + live weekly-stats sync on cell edit. Ported from SKS v3.10.54. (PR #183)
- **v3.5.69** — Resources: "Supervisor" → "Person in charge", now lists Direct employees too; `nominations.capacity_tag` source-tag stops the people/managers id-space collision. Ported from SKS v3.10.53. (PR #181)
- **v3.5.68** — Forecast: "suggest N workers" now divides by a 40-hour work week (was 38), so the hint no longer runs high. Ported from SKS v3.10.52. (PR #178)
- **v3.5.67** — sw.js: "Update available" toast only fires on a genuine update (a prior `eq-field-*` cache existed), killing the first-install nag.
- **v3.5.66** — Design tokens re-vendored to @eq-solutions/tokens v1.3.1 (additive); tenant-tier theming — `applyTenantBranding` sets `data-tier` on `<html>`, Enterprise (melbourne) gets the deeper-teal accent. Mirrors Shell's brand.tsx.

## [2026-06-03] v3.5.65 — Sync from SKS NSW Labour v3.10.50–51 (PR #173, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code
Manual cross-repo port (shared codebase). No DB changes. (1) Timesheets jump-to-top fix (live bug): `renderCurrentPage` split into `_renderCurrentPageDispatch()` + a wrapper that preserves scroll/focus/caret across the rebuild that fires on every realtime echo/poll/post-write refresh. (2) Resources "This week" strip in `sks-pipeline-resource.js`: jobs live · allocated · on the roster · free (non-fatal schedule fetch). Aggregate only.

## [2026-06-03] v3.5.64 — Phase 2 (Goal 1): close anon leak + bucket-B + realtime (PR #172, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code
REVOKED anon on the 22 migrated `public.*` tables (incl. `public.tenders`) — leak closed, prod anon→401 (edge fns use service_role, unaffected). `public.app_config` left anon (gate reads PINs pre-login → separate auth refactor). Bucket-B secured (field_* twins): job_numbers, regions, projects, project_targets, roster_presence. `realtime.js` repointed to `app_data.field_*` via the data JWT (publication + replica identity full; degrades to poll). Carrier now stamps `org_id` on JWT POSTs (twins keep org_id for composite PKs). Migration: `field_bucketb_realtime_closeleak`.

## [2026-06-03] v3.5.63 — Phase 2 (Goal 1): secure Tender Pipeline + retire 9 dead tables (PR #171, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code
Tender Pipeline secured onto the JWT (in active use → 323 rows copied into field_* twins; `public.*` kept as fallback): tenders, tender_enrichment, tender_import_runs, tender_review_decisions, nominations, pending_schedule. Dropped 9 dead/empty Field tables on EQ (staff_availability, unavailability, leave_balances, checkins, field_customers, field_waitlist, buddy_checkins, quarterly_reviews, engagement_log). Foreign tables (workers/worker_*/qualifications, organisations) intentionally untouched. Apprentices deferred. Migrations: `field_retire_bucket_d_dead_tables`, `field_secure_tender_pipeline_goal1`.

## [2026-06-03] v3.5.62 — Phase 2 (Goal 1): secure same-shape cutover, first 11 surfaces (PR #170, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code
Anon-exposure remediation Phase 2, "Goal 1 — secure same-shape": move surfaces off the anon key onto the authenticated data-plane JWT WITHOUT re-homing onto canonical (lossy — canonical app_data.staff/sites aren't supersets; deferred as B5). Each surface = `app_data.field_<name>` (`LIKE public.* INCLUDING ALL` + tenant_id RLS, anon revoked, granted authenticated). people, sites, schedule, timesheets, timesheet_locks, leave_requests, managers, audit_log, prestarts, toolbox_talks, site_diaries. Migrations: `field_secure_homes_phase2_goal1`, `field_secure_homes_org_id_nullable`.

## [2026-06-03] v3.5.61 — Phase 1 auth carrier: data-plane Supabase JWT (PR #168, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code
Security remediation Phase 1 (carrier only, dormant). verify-pin gains `signSupabaseJwt` + `mint-data-jwt` (signs a per-tenant zaap JWT with `ZAAP_JWT_SECRET`, ~1h TTL); supabase.js gains a dual-mode JWT path (JWT_TABLES, started EMPTY) for app_data access. No surface migrated. EQ app_data tenant_id = `dcb71d03` ("core"). Prod-smoked.

## [2026-06-03] v3.5.60 — revert licence admin (redundant vs canonical worker-home) (PR #167, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code
Reverted the licence-admin screen — redundant against the canonical worker-home model.

## [2026-06-03] v3.5.59 — Pipeline import: normalise email-form estimators (PR #166, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** Estimator dedupe. The Smartsheet 'SKS Estimator' cell sometimes arrives as an email, so one person showed as several filter options (e.g. Matthew Miller / matthew.miller@sks.com.au / Matthew.Miller@sks.com.au). `tender-parser.js` now converts email-form values to name form on import; name-form values left as typed.

**One-time SQL cleanup applied** (collapses existing rows) to EQ `zaapmfdkgedqupfjtchl` + SKS `nspbmirochztcjijmcrx` tenders: `update tenders set estimator = initcap(replace(split_part(estimator,'@',1),'.',' ')) where estimator like '%@%'`. Verified: Matthew Miller→6, Simon Bramall→16, zero '@' estimators remain.

**SKS:** shipped as **v3.10.49** (PR #23), live.

**Housekeeping:** old EQ DB `ktmjmdzqrogauaevbktn` (cold backup since v3.5.50) — Royce chose to pause it, but Supabase only pauses free-tier projects and it's paid. **Action for Royce:** downgrade it to free tier in the Supabase dashboard, then it can be paused / auto-pauses. Not done.

**PR:** [#166](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/166) — **merged**, live.

## [2026-06-03] v3.5.58 — Resources: editing workers/duration rebuilds the labour plan (PR #165, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** Closes the v3.5.57 limitation — changing start/workers/duration on a confirmed job saved the numbers but the labour plan (Assign-to-Roster tracks/slots) didn't reflow. `saveConfirmedDetails` now calls `_rebuildLabourPlan`, which regenerates `pending_schedule` from the new numbers. Roster-safe: if any slots were already pushed (`confirmed_at` set) it leaves the plan untouched and the toast warns to adjust manually; clears the plan if start/workers/duration are incomplete.

**SKS:** shipped to standalone repo as **v3.10.48** (PR #22), live.

**PR:** [#165](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/165) — **merged**, live.

## [2026-06-03] v3.5.57 — Resources: edit confirmed-job details; pipeline shows start date (PR #164, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** Confirmed jobs on the Resources screen now have an 'Edit details' block — start date / est hours / duration / peak workers / PM / supervisor / notes — so dates/hours can be amended after confirmation. Writes to `tender_enrichment` (+ `nominations`), the same tables the pipeline board reads, so changes flow through. Pipeline cards now also show a Start date tag.

**Changes:**
- `scripts/sks-pipeline-resource.js` — shared `_detailsFields` helper (Needs-Alloc panel + confirmed Edit block); `_editDetailsSection` / `toggleEditDetails` / `saveConfirmedDetails`.
- `scripts/sks-pipeline.js` — Start date tag on cards.
- **Known limit:** structural changes (workers/duration/start) save + warn but do NOT auto-rebuild the labour plan (protects already-pushed roster). Possible follow-up.

**SKS:** shipped to standalone repo as **v3.10.47** (PR #21) — which also carried the estimator/builder filters (the held #20 was superseded/closed). SKS now live with estimator/builder + edit-confirmed + start-date tag.

**PR:** [#164](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/164) — **merged**, live.

## [2026-06-03] v3.5.56 — Pipeline: filter by estimator + builder (PR #163, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** Two more header dropdowns on the pipeline board — Estimator (`tenders.estimator`) and Builder (`tenders.client`) — alongside department/vertical, applied together with the value/probability sliders.

**Notes:** No literal 'builder' column; `client` holds the head-contractors (126 distinct). `estimator` has import dupes (e.g. name vs email) that show as separate options until cleaned.

**SKS:** sibling PR sks-nsw-labour #20 (v3.10.46) raised + green, **held** (not merged) pending Royce smoke.

**PR:** [#163](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/163) — **merged**, live.

---

## [2026-06-03] v3.5.55 — Pipeline: value+probability sliders + Keep/Discard triage (PR #162, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** Two pipeline-board features. (1) The value-preset dropdown is replaced by two range sliders — Min value ($, dynamic max from data) and Min probability (%, backed by `tenders.probability_pct`, 0–100). Both apply together; labels update live on drag, filter on release. (2) Keep/Discard triage on every card — user decides (no auto-stale rule yet).

**Changes:**
- `scripts/sks-pipeline.js` — sliders (`setProbFilter`/`lblVal`/`lblProb`), `keepJob` (stamps `tenders.reviewed_at`, card shows ✓ Reviewed), `discardJob` (archives via `tenders.archived_at`, confirm via shared `#modal-confirm`). Buttons stopPropagation.
- **Migration:** `tenders.reviewed_at` (timestamptz, additive/nullable) applied to ktmjmdzqrogauaevbktn (EQ active), zaapmfdkgedqupfjtchl (canonical-internal), nspbmirochztcjijmcrx (SKS live).
- Version bump 3.5.54 → 3.5.55.

**Also shipped to SKS standalone:** sks-nsw-labour v3.10.45 (PR #19, live) — same feature in `scripts/pipeline.js`.

**Flag:** EQ pipeline tenders (333) live in the *original* `ktmjmdzqrogauaevbktn`, NOT eq-canonical-internal (1 row). The v3.5.50 registry flip didn't migrate pipeline data — reconcile before declaring the canonical cutover complete.

**PR:** [#162](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/162) — **merged**.

## [2026-06-03] v3.5.54 — Resources: Remove job confirm fix (BUG-009) (PR #161, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** The v3.5.53 "Remove job" button appeared but did nothing — `removeProject()` gated on `window.confirm()`, which is silently swallowed inside the eq-shell iframe and in iOS PWA standalone (returns false), so it bailed with no dialog. Fixed by routing through the shared `#modal-confirm` dialog.

**Changes:**
- `scripts/sks-pipeline-resource.js` — new `_raConfirm()` helper (promise-based, uses `#modal-confirm`, falls back to `window.confirm`); `removeProject()` now awaits it. Same BUG-009 pattern as timesheets/leave/apprentices.
- Version bump 3.5.53 → 3.5.54.

**PR:** [#161](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/161) — **merged**.

**Note:** Resources (sks-pipeline-resource) remove/archive is being trialled on the **eq** tenant and is intended for **SKS live** once validated — track for the SKS-side merge.

---

## [2026-06-03] v3.5.53 — Resources: remove/archive a job (PR #160, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** The Resources (Resource Allocation) screen could add jobs ("+ Add Active Job") but never remove them. Added a **Remove job** action on both Needs Allocation and Confirmed jobs. Shipped to trial on the eq tenant.

**Changes:**
- `scripts/sks-pipeline-resource.js` — `removeProject()` sets `tenders.archived_at` (reversible soft-remove, matching the pipeline "kill" pattern). Job disappears from Resources + Pipeline; roster entries already pushed to `schedule` are left in place. Confirm dialog before archiving.
- Remove buttons added to the Needs Allocation panel footer and the Confirmed labour-curve panel footer.
- Confirmed rows with no labour slots now still open a panel (`_emptyConfirmedPanel`) so they can be removed.
- Version bump 3.5.52 → 3.5.53 (app-state.js, sw.js, index.html banner).

**PR:** [#160](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/160) — **merged**.

---

## [2026-06-02] v3.5.52 — Licence admin surface (PR #158, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** Licence administration panel on the Supervision page — type toggle, expiry reminders, gap alerts, and an admin review gate for imported licences (Phase 3). Degrades gracefully until the migration is applied.

**Changes:**
- `scripts/licence-admin.js` + `migrations/2026-06-02_licence_admin.sql`.
- RLS policies for the licence admin tables.

**PR:** [#158](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/158) — **merged**.

---

## [2026-06-02] v3.5.51 — Lazy loader dependency fixes
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** Fixed first-visit lazy-load gaps on the contacts and sites tabs.

**Changes:**
- `lazy-loader.js`: contacts tab now loads managers.js alongside people.js (Add Contact calls a managers.js fn); sites tab now loads roster.js before sites.js (renderSites → getWeekSchedule lives in roster.js).
- `sites.js`: defensive typeof guard on getWeekSchedule().

---

## [2026-06-02] v3.5.50 — eq-canonical-internal live as EQ tenant DB (PR #155, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** EQ Field operational data now lives in eq-canonical-internal (`zaapmfdkgedqupfjtchl`). The eq-canonical registry was flipped so all three EQ demo tenants (eq, demo-trades, melbourne) resolve to eq-canonical-internal at boot. eq-solves-field (`ktmjmdzqrogauaevbktn`) becomes cold backup — no data deleted, no code changes required.

**Changes:**
- `migrations/2026-06-02_eq_canonical_internal_schema.sql` — 49-table schema + 5 enums + all indexes + RLS policies applied to eq-canonical-internal (exact mirror of eq-solves-field as of 2026-06-02).
- eq-canonical `organisations` table: `supabase_url` + `supabase_anon_key` updated for eq/demo-trades/melbourne → `zaapmfdkgedqupfjtchl.supabase.co`.
- Netlify `LEAVE_SB_URL` + `LEAVE_SB_KEY` env vars updated on eq-solves-field site → eq-canonical-internal; `approve-leave.js` and `send-email.js` magic-link mode now resolve against the live tenant DB.
- Version bump 3.5.49 → 3.5.50; v3.5.49 banner entry (SW auto-update toast + PIN from app_config) backfilled.

**Note:** eq-canonical-internal starts clean. All new data (roster entries, timesheets, leave requests) writes there. The 605 people + 2417 schedule rows previously in eq-solves-field were also migrated for reference but are not needed — the operational DB is authoritative.

**PR:** [#155](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/155) — **merged**.

## [2026-05-30] v3.5.34 — On-screen chrome is tenant-aware (PR #147, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** On-screen counterpart to the v3.5.33 print brand fix. `styles/base.css` used `--navy` (SKS `#1F335C`, `:root`-flagged "no EQ token") as EQ Field's primary on-screen colour in ~30 places — primary buttons, section/modal titles, active pills/tabs, table headers, the EQ Agent panel, the sidebar — so EQ-tenant chrome rendered in SKS navy.

**Changes:**
- `styles/base.css` — one override `body:not(.tenant-sks) { --navy / --navy-2 / --navy-3 }` remaps the navy accent family to EQ deep `#2986B4` for every tenant except SKS, flipping all ~30 usages at once. Dark chrome surfaces (`.sidebar`, `#eq-agent-fab`, `#eq-agent-header`) carved to EQ ink `#1A1A2E` per the design profile (not blue). `:root` untouched → SKS byte-identical (keeps navy).
- Version stamps → v3.5.34 (`APP_VERSION`, `sw.js` CACHE + banner, in-HTML banner).

**Verified:** computed styles on the deploy preview, both tenants — EQ deep accents + ink sidebar/FAB/header; SKS navy throughout.
**PR:** [#147](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/147) — **merged** (`3f02cc1`).
**Note:** PR #146 was a same-fix duplicate of #145 (print) built concurrently; closed unmerged.

## [2026-05-30] v3.5.33 — Print/PDF brand fix + 3 core features (PR #145, merged)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** `styles/print.css` (shared EQ/SKS sheet) hardcoded SKS navy → EQ roster PDFs printed navy. Made the roster `<thead>`, print-header underline, and "Weekly Roster" title tenant-aware: EQ deep `#2986B4` default, SKS navy under `body.tenant-sks` (the class is present in `@media print`, unlike runtime CSS vars). Also shipped the weekly site-attendance report, roster bulk assign/clear, and mobile roster week-swipe. SKS print output unchanged.
**PR:** [#145](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/145) — **merged** (`509c6a3`). Full detail in `sessions/2026-05-30.md`.

> v3.5.24–v3.5.32 shipped via the in-HTML banner (the canonical changelog for the v3.5.x series per eq-field CLAUDE.md) and are not backfilled here.

## [2026-05-29] v3.5.23 — Phase 1 eq_role wiring (PR #135, pending merge)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + Claude Code

**Summary:** All three auth paths (PIN, shell-token, shell-cookie) now derive and propagate `eq_role` to `window.EQ_SESSION.app_metadata.eq_role`, wiring the Phase D slot in `permissions.js` so `EQ_PERMS.getRole()` resolves the full role tier without a DB lookup.

**Changes:**
- `netlify/functions/verify-pin.js` — PIN success path: derives `eq_role` from `role` (supervisor → `'supervisor'`, else `'employee'`); passes as 4th arg to `signToken()`; returns in response body
- `scripts/auth.js` — after successful login on all 3 paths, stores `data.eq_role` into `window.EQ_SESSION.app_metadata.eq_role`
- `scripts/app-state.js` — `APP_VERSION` `3.5.22` → `3.5.23`
- `sw.js` — CACHE `eq-field-v3.5.22` → `eq-field-v3.5.23`; banner bumped
- `index.html` — CHANGES IN v3.5.23 block prepended

**PR:** [#135](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/135) — **pending Royce smoke test + squash-merge**  
**Preview:** `https://deploy-preview-135--eq-solves-field.netlify.app/`

## [2026-05-19 PM] Project-folder audit (HTML showcase) + stale substrate drafts reverted

**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant

**Context:** Evening Code session after the morning Phase 1.B audit-review merge pass. Royce asked for an overnight interactive HTML audit of every project folder in `C:\Projects\` with brutal-mode ratings, then later asked about "finishing" EQ Shell. The session produced the showcase, drafted a migration plan + `@eq/shell-contract` skeleton, and proposed substrate updates positioning Shell as a "canonical layer" alongside Field-as-lead-build. Pre-flight against actual `eq-shell` repo state revealed the drafts were built on a stale "Phase 1.B in flight" model — reality (verified at evening pre-flight): Phase 1.A + 1.B + 1.B-followup + Phase 2 spike all merged via PRs #1 / #2 / #3, PR #4 open with the handoff runbook, autonomous session in flight on `claude/phase-2-import-screen`. Drafts discarded; this entry captures only what was actually preserved.

**Shipped:**

- `C:\Projects\eq-showcase.html` — single-file interactive audit of 17 project folders + loose files at the C:\Projects root. Brutal-mode ratings (S → F), filterable card grid, EQ Shell hero panel (rated A+ as canonical-layer thesis), three-column verdict (strong / weak / waste), `localStorage`-persisted comment box. Dark gallery aesthetic — `Instrument Serif` headings, `Space Grotesk` body, `JetBrains Mono` annotations. Deliberately ignores EQ brand colours per brief ("ignore EQ design, get creative"). Not committed to any repo — lives at C:\Projects root as a build artefact.

**Reverted (working-tree only, never pushed):**

- 4 edits in `eq-context` (`ops/decisions.md` proposed "Shell as canonical layer" decision entry; `eq/products.md` proposed Shell section; `eq/pending.md` proposed Shell phase items; `eq/changelog/eq-context.md` self-changelog entry) — all `git checkout`-ed back to origin.
- `sessions/2026-05-19.md` — deleted (file was new, untracked).

**Deleted:**

- `C:\Projects\eq-shell-migration\` — entire folder removed (`SHELL-MIGRATION-PLAN.md` + `packages/shell-contract/` skeleton + README). The plan's §1 simplification critique flagged 5 mechanisms as premature for current scale (React.lazy code splitting, 60s HMAC iframe tokens, separate `shell-control` Supabase, three Netlify functions with service-role-key isolation, brand-from-DB at runtime). Reality: all 5 already shipped cleanly in Phase 1.B — the critique was too late to re-litigate. The `@eq/shell-contract` skeleton was unnecessary; Shell is shipping with inline types and the team isn't experiencing the type-drift the package would have prevented. Folder served its purpose as an exploration exercise; not worth preserving.

**Audit-surfaced cull findings (logged here, not yet escalated to PRs):**

- `eq-website/` — 42,647 files, undeployed, last touched April. Either ship to `eq.solutions` via Cloudflare Pages or `rm -rf`.
- `flutter/` — 17,130 files of upstream Flutter SDK clone. Belongs in `~/dev/sdks/flutter/`, not project root.
- `eq-solves-jobs/` — single HTML commissioning page in a folder. Promote to a doc, delete folder.
- `akko-jobsetup/`, `sks-nsw-labour/` — client/staging material in dev workspace. Belongs in OneDrive / client storage.
- `For upload/` — staging entropy. Figure out and delete.
- Stack inconsistency: `eq-cards` is the only Flutter project across the EQ portfolio. Open decision — commit to mobile-first (Cards drives Intake confirm-UI) or kill.
- `eq-analytics-v2` — placeholder `phc_REPLACE_ME` config dormant for 29 days. Provision PostHog (EU) + Clarity accounts or delete folder.

**Decisions punted:**

- Cull execution on the 6 folders above — surfaced only, no PRs opened.
- The Shell "simplification" architectural read from the deleted migration plan — too late to re-litigate, Phase 1.B already shipped the architecture as scoped.
- Whether to formally document "Shell as canonical layer" in `eq/products.md` — deferred until Shell has a real entry shape worth committing. Morning changelog entry already covers Shell work as Field-side; treating Shell as its own product line in substrate can wait until Phase 1.D unblocks and a non-Field module ships under it.

**Look at this first next session:**

- **PR #4 on `eq-solutions/eq-shell`** (`HANDOFF-PHASE-1-A-B.md`) — 3 Royce-only manual handoffs (Netlify env vars, GitHub→Netlify repo link, `*.eq.solutions` wildcard DNS). These are the only thing blocking Phase 1.D smoke test per the morning entry; nothing in the evening session moved them.
- **Active autonomous session on `claude/phase-2-import-screen`** — WIP on `src/modules/tender-pipeline/pages/Import.tsx`, new `lib/`, new `styles.css`, `package.json` changes. Do not touch this branch from a new session unless Royce explicitly confirms it's stale.
- **`C:\Projects\eq-showcase.html`** — review at leisure; the comment box is `localStorage`-only so scratch notes don't leave the browser.

## [2026-05-19] Phase 1.B audit-review merge pass + scope-reduce
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Context:** Morning review of the overnight build (eq-field-app PR #106 #107 #108 + eq-shell #1 #2) and the overnight audit (eq-field-app PR #108 / [OVERNIGHT-AUDIT-2026-05-19.md](https://github.com/Milmlow/eq-field-app/blob/demo/OVERNIGHT-AUDIT-2026-05-19.md)).
**Merged:**
- `eq-field-app` **PR #106** (Phase 1.C v3.5.9 — Field-side handshake token) — auth-surface, merged as-is after audit verdict LGTM.
- `eq-field-app` **PR #107** (docs hygiene) — placeholder `PR # — fill in after merge` patched to `PR #2` on the branch before merge.
- `eq-field-app` **PR #108** (overnight audit summary doc — `OVERNIGHT-AUDIT-2026-05-19.md`) — preserved as audit-trail artefact on demo.
- `eq-solutions/eq-shell` **PR #1** (Phase 1.B wire-up — shell auth + iframe handoff) — auth-surface, merged as-is per Royce's call. 8 audit should-fixes deferred to follow-up rather than blocking this merge.
**Follow-up PRs on eq-shell (also merged in this session):**
- **PR #3 — Phase 1.B follow-up** addressing all 8 audit should-fixes: timing-safe HMAC sig comparison (`crypto.timingSafeEqual` via `sigsEqual()` helper), display-name stopgap (`user.email.split('@')[0]` so Field sidebar shows `test` not `test@eq.solutions`), structured stdout audit log on every shell-login attempt (`logShellLogin()` helper), DB error message no longer leaked in 500 response body, `last_login_at` update error captured + console.warn'd, `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"` on the EQ Field iframe, `allow-popups` dropped from the iframe sandbox, role mapping comment expanded. 87+/14-, 4 files. Type-checked clean. Merged 2026-05-19. Deliberately defers: `users.name` column migration, rate limiting on `shell-login`, real `audit_log` table, timing-safe HMAC fix on eq-field-app side.
- **PR #2 — Phase 2 spike**, force-pushed (`b302ea7` → `4af3993`) and scope-reduced: branched off post-Phase-1.B main (d822af8), deletes only the 10-line `src/modules/tender-pipeline.tsx` stub from PR #1, and adds the directory tree with 5 lazy-loaded placeholder pages (Import / Kanban / Review / Enrichment / Curve). No App.tsx touch. The audit's auth-bypass risk (the original commit removed `SessionProvider` / `RequireSession`) is eliminated. Merged 2026-05-19.
- **PR #4 — `HANDOFF-PHASE-1-A-B.md`** one-page runbook documenting the three manual steps Royce needs to do by hand before Phase 1.D smoke testing unblocks: set 3 Netlify env vars (`EQ_SECRET_SALT` from eq-solves-field, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`), link `eq-solutions/eq-shell` GitHub repo to `eq-shell` Netlify project, configure `*.eq.solutions` wildcard CNAME + Netlify domain alias. Each step has exact dashboard URLs, copy sources, secret flags, and verification curls. Plus a 4-line smoke test (seed SQL + login + iframe handshake) and a failure-mode reading guide. Also includes a rollback section. Doc-only (197 lines, 1 file). Merged 2026-05-19.
**New-window prompt:** `C:\Users\EQ\Desktop\NEW-WINDOW-PROMPT-eq-shell.md` written 2026-05-19. Successor to NEW-WINDOW-PROMPT-melbourne-ready.md (Melbourne-ready closed out on the Field side). Captures pre-flight, what's-shipped, pending manual handoffs, four next-session paths (A: Phase 1.D smoke; B: Phase 2 proper starting with Import; C: 5 deferred follow-ups; D: NVDA), active parallel work flag (`claude/phase-2-import-screen` WIP), hard rules, auto-merge bar.
**README update (eq-shell main):** companion-infrastructure table refreshed; required env-var matrix added; auth contract documented inline.
**Pending Royce manual handoffs (carried forward):**
- Set Netlify env vars on `eq-shell` project: `EQ_SECRET_SALT` (must match eq-solves-field's value), `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
- Link `eq-solutions/eq-shell` GitHub repo to the `eq-shell` Netlify project for auto-deploy.
- Configure `*.eq.solutions` wildcard custom-domain DNS.
- NVDA spot-check on EQ Field v3.5.8 (modal focus + aria-live) — owed since 2026-05-18.
**Status:** EQ Field demo HEAD now includes PR #106 (Field-side shell handshake) — pure no-op on direct visits; activates only when a shell iframe ships a `#sh=<token>` hash. EQ Shell main now includes the Phase 1.B wire-up. Two open PRs (#2, #3) extend that foundation and are awaiting your review. Phase 1.D smoke test unblocks once the three manual handoffs are done.

## [2026-05-18 overnight] Phase 1.B wire-up + docs hygiene + Phase 2 spike
**Built by:** Claude (autonomous overnight run, Royce reviews in the morning)
**Brief:** "EQ Shell" overnight prompt — Phase 1.B + docs hygiene + Phase 2 spike, open PRs only, NEVER merge.
**Branches:**
- `claude/phase-1-b-wire-up` on `eq-solutions/eq-shell` → [PR #1](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-shell/pull/1)
- `claude/audit-doc-hygiene-2026-05-18` on `Milmlow/eq-field-app` → [PR #107](https://github.com/Milmlow/eq-field-app/pull/107)
- `claude/phase-2-spike-tender-pipeline` on `eq-solutions/eq-shell` → [PR #2](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-shell/pull/2)
**Companion changes (no new infra; uses Phase 1.A's provisioned resources):**
- Supabase migration `2026_05_18_phase_1b_pin_hash_and_service_role_policies` applied to `eq-shell-control` (`hxwitoveffxhcgjvubbd`): adds `users.pin_hash TEXT`, plus service-role-only ALL policies on `tenants` / `users` / `module_entitlements`. HONEST CAVEAT in migration header — not the long-term `auth.uid()` shape; precedent set in `2026-05-13_roster_presence_rls_tighten.sql` + `2026-05-18_tender_rls_tighten.sql`.

**Changes:**
- **Phase 1.B wire-up (PR #1 on eq-shell):** Three TS Netlify functions — `shell-login` (POST email + bcrypt PIN → sets `eq_shell_session` cookie on `.eq.solutions`, signed with shared `EQ_SECRET_SALT`), `verify-shell-session` (GET → hydrates user/tenant/entitlements; 401 on invalid; rejects if cookie tenant_id no longer matches canonical), `mint-iframe-token` (POST → 60s shell-token in the exact shape Phase 1.C's `verifyShellToken` expects). React Router shell: `SessionProvider` hydrates on mount, `RequireSession` guards `/:tenantSlug/*`, `ModuleGate` enforces entitlements per route. `BrandProvider` writes tenant `brand_color` to `--eq-brand` CSS custom property (Q6 lock). `FieldIframe` POSTs to `mint-iframe-token` and embeds `https://eq-solves-field.netlify.app/#sh=<token>`. Cards / Intake / Quotes / Service / Tender Pipeline ship as separate lazy chunks per Q5 (vite build verified). Shared HMAC helpers + lazy service-role Supabase client in `netlify/functions/_shared/`. **Do NOT auto-merge** — auth surface change.
- **Docs hygiene (PR #107 on eq-field-app):** AUDIT-REVIEW.md — moved FINDING #S1 + FINDING #S2 from open to closed with full per-PR breakdowns (PRs #89/#91/#92/#95 for the four phases / three workstreams), added new "Session — 2026-05-18 → 2026-05-19" iteration log entry covering Phase A+B+C+D + EQ Shell pivot + 1.A/1.B/1.C work. SPRINT-PLAN.md — ticked the four "Order to tackle" workstreams as shipped (S1/U2/SEC2/S2), updated U2 + S2 status blocks, added new "EQ Shell" section pointing at `EQ-SHELL-DESIGN.md`. DEMO-VS-LIVE.md — refreshed deploy-snapshot table to HEAD `7249833` post-PR #104, added v3.5.7 → v3.5.9 / EQ Shell Phase 1.C section. ~157 lines net; within auto-merge bar but left open per the brief.
- **Phase 2 spike (PR #2 on eq-shell):** 5 placeholder routes under `/<tenant>/tender-pipeline/{import|kanban|review|enrichment|curve}`, each a `React.lazy()` chunk. Each stub documents the vanilla source line range in `scripts/tender-pipeline.js` (import: 276-540, kanban: 542-750, enrichment: 752-961, review: 963-1455, curve: 1457-1900) + the deps to use during the proper migration. Added Phase 2 stack deps: `@dnd-kit/core`, `@dnd-kit/sortable`, `@tanstack/react-table`, `react-hook-form`. Branched off `main` (NOT off Phase 1.B) so the two PRs are reviewable independently.

**Decisions punted to Royce (morning):**
1. **Netlify env vars on the `eq-shell` project** — must set before functions run: `EQ_SECRET_SALT` (SAME value as eq-solves-field; HMAC handshake breaks if different), `SUPABASE_URL` (`https://hxwitoveffxhcgjvubbd.supabase.co`), `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (from Supabase dashboard — service-role key not readable via MCP).
2. **Netlify ↔ GitHub link on `eq-shell`** — project provisioned empty in Phase 1.A, still not connected. Royce wires after reviewing PR #1.
3. **Logout endpoint on eq-shell** — Phase 1.B's logout button just navigates to `/`; the HttpOnly cookie expires in 7d. Adding `shell-logout` that sends `Set-Cookie: ...; Max-Age=0` is a small follow-up.
4. **Rate limiting on `shell-login`** — same gap eq-solves-field's verify-pin had pre-SEC2 (PR #99). Extend the same `rate_limit_buckets` RPC pattern to this surface in a follow-up.

**Deferred / out-of-scope:**
- DNS for `*.eq.solutions` — per the brief guardrail (no DNS changes).
- NVDA / VoiceOver U2 verification — outside the Claude harness.
- SKS prod ports (S1 / U2 / SEC2 etc.) remain in PR #93 + DEMO-VS-LIVE.md decision matrix; left for explicit Royce instruction.
- Per-user `auth.uid()`-based RLS on the canonical Supabase — waits for the day client-side Supabase access matters (Phase 2+).
- End-to-end smoke (Phase 1.D) — needs Netlify deploy live + env vars set. Royce runs after morning review.

**Status:** Three PRs open, none merged. eq-field-app/demo HEAD unchanged (`7249833`). eq-solutions/eq-shell main unchanged. `eq-shell-control` Supabase has one new migration applied (pin_hash + service-role policies). No version banner / APP_VERSION / sw.js bumps on EQ Field — overnight run touched only the docs files on demo, and the v3.5.9 banner ship is still PR #106 (Phase 1.C). Next session resumes from Royce's morning review of PRs #1, #107, #2 — with env vars set + Netlify GitHub link wired, Phase 1.D end-to-end smoke can run.

## [2026-05-18] Phase D EQ Shell — design locked + Phase 1.A scaffold provisioned
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Brief:** Phase D of `NEW-WINDOW-PROMPT-melbourne-ready.md` (design pivot per the cowork EQ Shell architecture)
**Branches:** `claude/phase-d-eq-shell-design` (PR #104, merged 13:25Z)
**Companion repos / projects (new):**
- GitHub: [`eq-solutions/eq-shell`](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-shell) (private, main branch, Vite + React + TS scaffold pushed)
- Supabase: `eq-shell-control` (id `hxwitoveffxhcgjvubbd`, region ap-southeast-2, EQ Solutions org, $10/mo)
- Netlify: `eq-shell` (id `a3473f83-7c82-4f1e-872d-aa96eaa55172`, milmlow team, `eq-shell.netlify.app`)
**Changes:**
- **Design locked (PR #104):** All 10 architecture questions resolved. EQ Shell is Vite + React + TypeScript, hosted at `*.eq.solutions` on Netlify with a canonical Supabase (`eq-shell-control`) for tenants / users / module_entitlements / branding. Cookie auth on `*.eq.solutions` for React modules; URL-hash HMAC token for the cross-domain EQ Field iframe. EQ Field stays vanilla and embedded via iframe initially; Tender Pipeline migration to React shell-routes is Phase 2 (the wedge); surface-by-surface Field migration is Phase 3+ as each needs rework. Auto-merge bar declined; Royce reviewed + merged manually.
- **Phase 1.A scaffolding provisioned:** Three real-world resources created in one pass — (1) `eq-solutions/eq-shell` GitHub repo (private, default Vite react-ts template plus a real README documenting the design + companion infra), (2) `eq-shell-control` Supabase project in Sydney (Royce confirmed $10/mo cost; canonical schema v1 applied with `tenants` / `users` / `module_entitlements` tables + `_touch_updated_at` trigger function with explicit `search_path = ''` to satisfy the database linter; RLS enabled on all three with no policies yet — deny-by-default until Phase 1.B's auth model lands), (3) `eq-shell` Netlify project on the milmlow team (empty container; needs GitHub integration + custom domain configured via dashboard — manual handoff to Royce per Netlify UI's better DX for these settings).
- **Substrate observation:** the cowork message Royce surfaced mid-session about Tender Pipeline's fortnightly review meeting being "the product, not the screen" reframed Phase D's scope. Adoption signal of "6 fortnightlies + 30 notes at month 3" is now preserved in the design doc as the Phase 2 success metric. Tender Pipeline's existing vanilla implementation (v3.4.79-83) lives on until the React port is shipped + soaked for ~2 weeks — no cutover risk.
**Status:** PR #104 merged to demo. Three new infra resources alive. Phase 1.B (wire-up: shell-login + verify-shell-session + mint-iframe-token Netlify functions + React shell with login + tenant-home + iframe-Field route) is the natural next session. Two open items deliberately handed off to Royce: (1) link the `eq-solutions/eq-shell` GitHub repo to the `eq-shell` Netlify project via the dashboard's auto-deploy integration, (2) configure the `*.eq.solutions` wildcard custom domain DNS. Both are 2-minute UI flows that the Netlify MCP doesn't cleanly cover.

## [2026-05-18] Phase C Melbourne prep — U2 accessibility cleared + Phase D design opened
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Brief:** `NEW-WINDOW-PROMPT-melbourne-ready.md` (Phase C of 5 + Phase D design pivot)
**Branches:** `claude/v3.5.7-u2-axe-fixes` (PR #102, merged), `claude/v3.5.8-u2-manual-pass` (PR #103 closed → re-opened as PR #105, merged), `claude/phase-d-eq-shell-design` (PR #104 open — design doc only)
**Changes:**
- **v3.5.7 — U2 Phase 2 (PR #102, merged 12:52Z):** axe-core 4.11.4 auto-flagged WCAG 2.1 AA findings against the live demo landing — 23 violations across 2 rules (21 × color-contrast serious, 2 × select-name critical). New text-safe CSS vars (`--green-text` #15803D, `--amber-text` #B45309, `--purple-text` #5B53A8 — brand variables kept for backgrounds and accents). Class-level updates to `.pill-green` / `.pill-amber` / `.stat-card-sub` / `.nav-label` + `.sidebar-footer`. Inline contrast bumps on sidebar dark-navy text (rgba(.32–.4) → rgba(.7–.75)), Pipeline/Trial NEW badges (cyan-500 → cyan-300), Job Numbers/Apprentices BETA badges. `aria-label` on `#globalWeek` and `#dash-group-filter` selects. Re-ran axe-core against the deploy preview — **0 violations**, 21 passes. Behaviour-preserving + additive; qualified for the brief's auto-merge bar but Royce reviewed and merged manually.
- **v3.5.8 — U2 Phase 3 (PR #105, merged 12:53Z; originally PR #103 stacked on #102, GitHub auto-closed when #102's branch was deleted, rebased + re-opened):** the manual-pass portion that axe-core can't catch. `scripts/utils.js` — `openModal`/`closeModal` refactored with `_modalTriggerStack`: stash trigger on open, restore focus to it on close, nested-modal aware (LIFO). `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal="true"` stamped lazily on first open. Tab keydown handler cycles focus inside the top-most open `.modal-overlay` (WCAG 2.4.3 + 2.1.1). Backdrop-click + ESC-to-close route through `closeModal` so focus restore fires. `#toast` in index.html gets `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"` + `aria-atomic="true"`. NVDA spot-check explicitly flagged as owed to Royce — the one verification step that can't run from the Claude harness.
- **Netlify env-var updates (out-of-PR, Royce-authorised):** set `RATE_LIMIT_V2=on` (functions scope, production context) to activate PR #99's distributed rate-limit RPC path on the EQ Netlify deploy. Then surfaced a pre-existing config bug: `verify-pin.js` reads `AUDIT_SB_URL` / `AUDIT_SB_KEY` env vars but only `LEAVE_SB_URL` / `LEAVE_SB_KEY` had been set — audit logging from the gate function had been silently no-op for some time, and the new `bumpRateLimitRPC` inherited the same short-circuit. Added `AUDIT_SB_URL` + `AUDIT_SB_KEY` env vars (same values as `LEAVE_*`, scope=functions, context=all). Next verify-pin cold start activates both audit logging and the RPC path. Long-term: rename in code to a single source-of-truth name (separate small PR).
- **Phase D design pivot — `EQ-SHELL-DESIGN.md` (PR #104 open):** the brief's Phase D framing (tenant onboarding admin flow inside EQ Field) is materially obsolete. Royce surfaced a different architecture mid-session: EQ Shell at `<tenant>.eq.solutions` hosting Cards / Intake / Quotes / Service / Field as lazy-loaded modules, with a "canonical layer per tenant" managing config + entitlements + branding at the shell layer. Drafted 177-line design doc capturing: ASCII topology, 10 open questions (Q1-Q10) that block code (highest-stakes: Q2 — EQ Field as React port vs iframe vs Web Component embed), proposed MVP shape (3-5 sessions, EQ Field as iframe child initially, canonical Supabase for tenant config only, no wizard MVP), explicit "what this doc does NOT propose". Doc-only PR; Royce reviews + answers Q1-Q4 (the four that unblock everything) before code starts.
- **AUDIT-REVIEW.md / SPRINT-PLAN.md / DEMO-VS-LIVE.md NOT updated** in this PR set — the Phase A+B summary PR #101 already covered through Phase B. A separate hygiene pass (Phase C closures + Phase D pivot recorded) is recommended when convenient; left for a future session to keep these PRs scoped.
**Status:** Demo on v3.5.8 (HEAD = `83cad05`). axe-core auto-flagged WCAG 2.1 AA = 0 violations on landing. Behind-gate surfaces (modal flows, etc.) wired with focus/aria semantics but await NVDA spot-check. Phase D design PR #104 open; awaiting Royce's Q1-Q4 answers before code. Phase E (post-Phase D) not started.

## [2026-05-18] Phase A+B Melbourne prep — security backlog cleared on demo
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Brief:** `NEW-WINDOW-PROMPT-melbourne-ready.md` (Phases A + B of 5)
**Branches:** `claude/melbourne-scale-verify` (Phase A, PR #97 open), `claude/sec3-tender-rls-rewrite` (PR #98, merged), `claude/sec2-phase-d-rate-limit` (PR #99, merged), `claude/sec1-magic-link-ttl-48h` (PR #100, merged), `claude/melbourne-session-2026-05-18-summary` (this doc-update PR)
**Changes:**
- **Phase A — Scale verification (PR #97 open):** Drove Claude-in-Chrome against `eq-solves-field.netlify.app/?seed500`. Verified live: Contacts virtualisation (498 people / 43 `<tr>` in DOM via `EQVirtualTable`), Edit Roster + Roster view `content-visibility: auto` on 498 rows each, sliding-window helpers wired (`_getVisibleWeekRange` returns 9 weeks), Tender Pipeline `EQ_TENDER_PIPELINE.loadAll()` returns 323 tenders + 12 nominations, mobile home tile flag default-on. Limitations recorded honestly: EQ tenant short-circuits Supabase so live `week=in.(...)` only exercised on SKS port (PR #93); supervisor home variant deferred (requires supervisor unlock). New doc `MELBOURNE-VERIFY-2026-05-18.md`.
- **Phase B1 — FINDING #SEC3 closed (PR #98, merged 11:33:17Z):** New migration `migrations/2026-05-18_tender_rls_tighten.sql`. All 24 placeholder `_anon_*` policies on the 6 tender tables replaced. 4 tables with direct `org_id` (tenders/tender_import_runs/tender_review_decisions/pending_schedule) gated on `org_id IS NOT NULL`. 2 tables without (nominations/tender_enrichment) gated on `EXISTS (tender_id → tenders.org_id IS NOT NULL)`. HONEST CAVEAT in migration header (mirrors `2026-05-13_roster_presence_rls_tighten.sql` precedent): EQ Field's anon-key auth model can't enforce `auth.uid()`-based RLS — cross-tenant read by anyone with the anon key remains structural until Wave 5+ SSO. The brief's prescribed `TO authenticated USING (auth.uid()...)` pattern was a wrong premise; surfaced and adjusted mid-session. Migration applied to EQ Supabase via MCP; app post-tighten still reads 323 tenders + 12 nominations.
- **Phase B2 — FINDING #SEC2 Phase D closed (PR #99, merged 11:33:29Z):** Migration `2026-05-15_rate_limit_buckets_v1.sql` activated — applied to EQ demo Supabase via MCP, RPC sanity-tested (5x true, 6th false), header updated from "DO NOT APPLY" to "Applied 2026-05-18". `netlify/functions/verify-pin.js` wired with env-var feature flag `RATE_LIMIT_V2`: when off (current state), serves the in-memory `attempts={}` path unchanged; when on, distributed `bump_rate_limit` RPC bucket lockout supersedes in-memory (kills the cold-start bypass that was the original finding). Belt-and-braces fallback: RPC blip falls through to in-memory. Tenant derived from request Origin (`sks` / `eq` / `unknown`). New client helper `bumpRateLimit(key, max, windowSeconds)` in `scripts/supabase.js` for future defence-in-depth use. **Activation requires setting `RATE_LIMIT_V2=on` in eq-solves-field Netlify env vars** — not auto-flipped by the merge.
- **Phase B3 — FINDING #SEC1 closed (PR #100, merged 11:33:38Z):** `LEAVE_ACTION_TTL_MS` dropped from `7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000` to `48 * 60 * 60 * 1000` in both `netlify/functions/send-email.js` and `supabase/functions/supervisor-digest/index.ts`. `approve-leave.js` header comment updated to match. Was parked 2026-05-13 with risk accepted; unparked for Melbourne procurement posture. Newly-minted approve/reject links expire after 48h; already-minted links keep their original `exp` until they hit it.
- `AUDIT-REVIEW.md` — session log entry appended; #SEC1/#SEC2/#SEC3 moved to Closed/shipped findings.
- `SPRINT-PLAN.md` — §SEC2 status block updated (Phase D ✅ shipped). §SEC1 in out-of-scope list updated (✅ shipped via PR #100).
- `DEMO-VS-LIVE.md` — Tender Pipeline SEC3 section rewritten (closed), §9 SEC2 section rewritten (closed pending env-var flip), "Risks on live" section updated, deploy snapshot table updated to post-#100 HEAD (`c9cde43`).
**Status:** Phase A doc PR (#97) still open — Royce's call. Phases B1/B2/B3 all merged to `demo`. Phase B GATE passed. `RATE_LIMIT_V2` env var NOT set; Phase D's RPC path is dormant code until that flip. SKS prod unaffected by any of this work — separate rollout decision per finding when Royce calls "SKS live". Phase C (FINDING #U2 accessibility, ~5-6h split across axe-core auto-fixes + manual focus/keyboard/aria-live pass) awaiting green-light. Phase D (tenant onboarding admin flow) is design-first; brief has four open questions (E1-E4) requiring Royce decisions.

## [2026-05-15] SEC2 design — rate-limit-buckets migration file (PENDING)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/sec2-rate-limit-buckets-design` → `demo` (PR #90)
**Changes:**
- New `migrations/2026-05-15_rate_limit_buckets_v1.sql` — `public.rate_limit_buckets` table + `public.bump_rate_limit(p_key, p_max, p_window_seconds)` RPC + RLS denial-by-default (service-role bypass). SQL lifted verbatim from `SPRINT-PLAN.md` §SEC2 per SPRINT-QUESTIONS Q9 default.
- File marked **PENDING** in top-comment header: DO NOT call `mcp__*__apply_migration` / `mcp__*__execute_sql`. Phase D consumes it when server-side role checks land, alongside wiring `bump_rate_limit()` into `netlify/functions/verify-pin.js` (replaces in-memory `attempts = {}` map flagged as FINDING #SEC2).
- `SPRINT-PLAN.md` §SEC2 — status block: Phase 1 ✅ shipped, Phase D ⏳ pending.
- `AUDIT-REVIEW.md` — FINDING #SEC2 moved from Open → Tracked findings with pointer to the migration file.
**Status:** SQL file on demo `migrations/` directory. **Not applied to EQ demo or SKS prod Supabase.** Phase D unblocks the actual fix.

## [2026-05-15] v3.5.3 — S1 sliding-window queries (Melbourne scaling unblocked)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/v3.5.3-s1-sliding-window` → `demo` (PR #89, merge `8890efd`; supersedes closed PR #88)
**Changes:**
- Resolves AUDIT-REVIEW FINDING #S1 (HIGH severity) — the single biggest Melbourne scaling blocker. `schedule?select=*` and `timesheets?select=*` were unscoped; at 577 ppl × 52 weeks (~30k rows) the page load + every 30s poll pulled 5–10MB. Unusable above ~100 users.
- All 5 phases bundled. Phase 1 — `STATE.loadedWeeks = new Set()` + `_getVisibleWeekRange()` helper (9-week window centred on current week). Phase 2 — `loadFromSupabase` + `loadTimesheets` now use `&week=in.(visibleWeeks)`. Phase 3 — `_loadWeeks(weekKeys)` lazy-loads on `onWeekChange` with adjacent ±4 prefetch + inline "↻ Loading…" indicator. Phase 4 — `_evictDistantWeeks()` caps `loadedWeeks` at 16, drops furthest-from-current first. Phase 5 — dashboard investigation confirmed no-op (renderDashboard + updateTopStats both scope to `STATE.currentWeek`).
- Bulk exports split off — `_loadFullDataForExport()` returns un-scoped snapshot; `exportScheduleCSV` pre-fetches via the helper. Single-week exports untouched (already scoped).
- Defaults applied per SPRINT-QUESTIONS: Q1 (±4 weeks / 9 visible), Q2 (always prefetch adjacent), Q3 (bulk-exports full-fetch on demand), Q4 (investigate dashboard first), Q5 (DEMO ONLY — SKS port after 3–5 days clean soak).
- Realtime channel still org-scoped (FINDING #S3 parked) — out-of-window updates dropped client-side; user sees them on next nav to that week.
**Status:** Live on demo. SKS prod (sks-nsw-labour) untouched, still on v3.4.73 — soak clock for v3.5.4 SKS port starts 2026-05-15.

## [2026-05-15] v3.5.2 — Site Reports HUB (collapses Prestart / Toolbox / Diary)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/v3.5.2-site-reports-hub` → `demo` (PR #85, merge `e4985c5`)
**Changes:**
- New `scripts/site-reports-hub.js` — single "Site Reports" sidebar entry lands on a HUB page with three status cards (Prestart · today / Toolbox · this week / Diary · today). Tap-through routes to the existing workflow via `showPage('prestart' | 'toolbox' | 'diary')`. Pre-loads all three caches in parallel on first render so counts are live.
- Three original sidebar entries (Prestart / Toolbox / Diary) **hidden** (inline `style="display:none"`), not deleted — deep-links + v3.5.0 staff home-tile Pre-starts tile still work.
- Count accessors added to each workflow module: `window.eqGetPrestartsTodayCount()`, `window.eqGetToolboxWeekCount()`, `window.eqGetDiariesTodayCount()`. SKS Prestart card suppressed via `TENANT_DISABLED_TABLES.sks`.
- Permissions: HUB always renders. Each card tap-through hits the underlying workflow which already enforces `reports.{prestart,toolbox,diary}.view` via `EQ_PERMS` — no double-gating needed in HUB.
**Status:** Live on demo. Weekly Site Report (next Site Reports milestone, ~6–8 days work) gated on at least one supervisor actually using all three workflows weekly.

## [2026-05-15] v3.5.1 — Mobile-first home tile screen: supervisor variant
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/v3.5.1-supervisor-home` → `demo` (PR #83, merge `c215571`)
**Changes:**
- Phase 2 of the mobile-first nav rollout (Phase 1 was v3.5.0 staff). Supervisors on mobile (viewport <768px, `isManager === true`, `home_screen_v1` flag on) land on a six-tile home screen plus action strip: "Needs you today · N leave to approve · N pre-start". Empty state shows a green "All clear" panel.
- TILES — Schedule, Timesheets, Leave, Pre-starts, Team, Reports. Decision G1: STATUS badges only on tiles (e.g. "New" on Pre-starts) — counts live exclusively on the action strip.
- COG DRAWER — supervisor variant adds Edit roster / Sites / Job numbers / Apprentices / Supervision / Import-Export / Audit log on top of the staff drawer.
- Action-strip data: `window.eqGetPendingLeaveCount()` (in leave.js) + `window.eqGetPrestartsDraftCount()` (in site-reports.js, distinct from HUB's `eqGetPrestartsTodayCount` — different semantics). "Timesheets to review" count **dropped** from MVP — timesheets have no review-state column.
- ROUTING — `initApp()` gets a parallel supervisor branch mirroring v3.5.0 staff. Desktop supervisor (≥768px) or flag-off keeps existing sidebar shell — no regression for the 90% of supervisor work happening at a desk.
- Reuses `home_screen_v1` flag (no separate flag). Draft `_proposals/mobile-first-nav/phase-2-supervisor-home.js` stamped SHIPPED IN v3.5.1 header.
**Status:** Live on demo. SKS sees this on mobile too since flag default-on for both tenants.

## [2026-05-15] Audit + CI chores (no version bump)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branches:** `claude/audit-slash-command` (PR #86, merge `e8ff20c`), `claude/u2-axe-ci-scaffold` (PR #87, merge `a005104`), `claude/audit-session-summary-2026-05-15` (PR #84, merge `067576c`)
**Changes:**
- `.claude/commands/audit-multi-lens.md` (PR #86) — on-demand `/audit-multi-lens` replacement for the dead cloud `/schedule`. Mirrors `REVIEW-MULTI-LENS.md` v1 three-perspective format, produces dated artifact in `_reviews/multi-lens/`.
- `.github/workflows/accessibility-audit.yml` (PR #87) — U2 Phase 1. Manual `workflow_dispatch` (no cron). Tenant dropdown `eq` | `sks`. axe-core CLI via npx; WCAG 2.0/2.1 A/AA; JSON + HTML reports uploaded as artifacts. CI report doubles as procurement-gate documentation.
- `AUDIT-REVIEW.md` Session entry for 2026-05-15 (PR #84) — captures state-of-the-world corrections + schema-correction table for the supervisor home draft.
**Status:** All three merged into demo same session. Axe workflow available to trigger manually any time; no auto-runs.


## [2026-05-14] v3.5.0 — Mobile-first home tile screen (staff role, flag-gated)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant (separate session)
**Branch:** `claude/v3.5.0-mobile-home` → `demo` (commits `6fe968c`, `89072b6`, `375a72f`, `b512c84`)
**Changes:**
- New `scripts/home.js` (~362 lines) — mobile-first tile screen for STAFF role. Four tiles: My Schedule, Timesheets, Leave, Pre-starts. Next-shift pill (decision B1). Cog drawer (slide-up sheet) for everything-else nav. PostHog page-view fires from here.
- New `styles/home.css` (~315 lines) — tile grid, pill, drawer, loading skeleton, offline banner. Hidden on viewport ≥ 768px (desktop staff keep existing shell).
- New PostHog flag `home_screen_v1` in `scripts/flags.js`. Default ON as of `b512c84` (after eyeballing the staff flow on phone). Routing fires only when (a) flag enabled (b) `role==='staff'` (c) viewport <768px.
- New `index.html` mount `<div id="page-home">`, `PAGE_TITLES.home`, dispatch in `renderCurrentPage`, routing in `initApp()` to choose home vs schedule landing.
- EQ blue diamond favicons (recoloured from navy `#1F335C` to EQ blue `#3DA8D8` gradient) shipped in same version.
- **v3.4.84 pipeline UI polish FOLDED IN** (commit message confirms): PM/Supervisor dropdowns now pull from `STATE.managers` (was `STATE.people`); Pipeline Dashboard + Review queue Stage/Dept filters; nomination name lookups check managers first then people. The orphan `CHANGELOG-v3.4.84.md` file remained on disk as historical doc; no separate version was published.
- Decisions baked in per `_proposals/mobile-first-nav/MOBILE-FIRST-NAV-PROPOSAL.md` v1.1: A1 (staff mobile only), B1 (next-shift pill), C1 (Pre-starts hidden on SKS via `TENANT_DISABLED_TABLES`), D (labels), E (greeting personality), H1 (greeting once per day then date), I1 (live counts on schedule + timesheets only).
**Status:** Live on demo. SKS prod still on v3.4.73 (flag default-on for both tenants but supervisor variant not in v3.5.0 — Phase 2 in #83).

## [2026-05-14] v3.4.83 — Tender Pipeline: onclick fix + Dashboard + job fields + session close + Promote UX
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/v3.4.83-pipeline-polish` → `demo` (commit `82123ff`)
**Changes:** Quality-of-life cleanup on the Tender Pipeline kanban: card onclick fixed for some edge cases, dashboard refinements, additional job fields surfaced, review-session close UX clarified, Promote-to-Schedule flow tightened. Pure UX polish — no schema changes.
**Status:** Live on demo. SKS untouched (Tender Pipeline is demo-only).

## [2026-05-14] v3.4.82 — Tender Pipeline: drag-and-drop kanban + Review = decision queue
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/v3.4.82-pipeline-dnd` → `demo` (commits `0ca5956`, `36bd23e` for the missed changelog)
**Changes:** Drag-and-drop on the Tender Pipeline kanban (stage transitions via DnD). "Review" surface restructured into a decision queue rather than a list. The v3.4.82 changelog commit was missed in the original push (sandbox /tmp path quirk) and landed in a follow-up `36bd23e`.
**Status:** Live on demo.

## [2026-05-14] v3.4.81 — Tender Sync actually working + What's New refresh
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/v3.4.81-tender-sync-fix` → `demo` (commit `36e4009`)
**Changes:**
- Tender Sync (Excel import) was DOA after v3.4.80 because the cdnjs URL pointed at xlsx 0.20.3 which cdnjs doesn't host. Pinned to xlsx 0.18.5 (last cdnjs-hosted build, same API surface).
- "What's New" banner refreshed — was stuck on v3.4.22-era content (digest, birthdays, timesheet bar). Now surfaces recent shipments: Tender Pipeline, Daily Site Diary, Toolbox Talks. WHATSNEW_KEY bumped to v3.4.81 so every user sees the banner once.
**Status:** Live on demo.

## [2026-05-14] v3.4.80 — CSP hotfix: unblock SheetJS for Tender Sync
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/v3.4.80-csp-fix` → `demo` (commit `9e7d901`)
**Changes:** Tender Sync (v3.4.79) was DOA on live demo — SheetJS CDN script blocked by CSP. Two CSP definitions live in the repo (`_headers` and inline meta tag); both relaxed to permit the SheetJS cdnjs origin. Real fix but not THE fix — v3.4.81 had to pin the actual cdnjs URL since the original 0.20.3 path 404'd.
**Status:** Live on demo.

## [2026-05-14] v3.4.79 — Tender Pipeline module (new workstream)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/v3.4.79-tender-pipeline` → `demo` (PR #82, squash merge `b587b78`)
**Changes:**
- New `scripts/tender-pipeline.js` (~1900 lines at ship time, ~2000 after the v3.4.80-84 patches landed) — kanban for tracking tender opportunities through stages (watch → confirmed → likely → won/lost). Drag-and-drop transitions, enrichment slide-over, nomination model, review queue.
- New `scripts/tender-parser.js` — Excel ingestion via SheetJS (xlsx). Parses tender intake spreadsheets into `tender_import_runs` rows. CSP needed v3.4.80 hotfix before this actually worked end-to-end.
- New Supabase migration creating `tenders`, `tender_enrichment`, `nominations`, `nomination_clashes` (view), `tender_import_runs`, `tender_review_decisions`, `pending_schedule`. DEMO ONLY — SKS tenant has these in `TENANT_DISABLED_TABLES.sks` so the fetches no-op.
- New sidebar entries: Pipeline Dashboard, Pipeline (kanban), Fortnightly Review, Tender Sync. Pipeline Dashboard surfaces stage-by-stage counts + filters.
**Status:** Live on demo. Not in any earlier brief — was Royce's mid-week pivot. Five subsequent versions of polish (v3.4.80–84) landed within 36 hours.

## [2026-05-13] v3.4.77 — Site Reports v3: Daily Site Diary MVP (DEMO ONLY)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/v3.4.77-diary` → `demo` (PR #81, squash merge `ceec471`)
**Changes:**
- New `scripts/diary.js` (~700 lines) — third workflow in Site Reports, sibling to Prestart and Toolbox. Consumes `scripts/site-reports-shared.js` (v3.4.76) for photo / signature / offline-queue controllers; only diary-specific logic remains in this file: weather JSONB, shift_type (day / night / split), repeating sections for work_areas / delays / incidents / visitors, free-text materials_received / equipment_status / notes.
- New migration `2026-05-13_site_diaries_v1.sql` — `site_diaries` table with same RLS + realtime pattern as `prestarts` and `toolbox_talks`. Photos JSONB included from day 1.
- `permission-matrix.js` updated — `reports.diary.{view,create,submit,sign}` added.
- New sidebar entry "Diary" under "Testing (DO NOT USE)", BETA chip, next to Prestart and Toolbox.
- Hub/dashboard restructure DEFERRED again (now three workflows exist — trigger condition reached — but soak first; HUB ships in PR #85 not yet merged).
**Status:** Live on demo. SKS untouched (diary tables not yet applied to SKS Supabase).

## [2026-05-13] v3.4.76 — Site Reports refactor: extract shared photos / signature / queue
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/v3.4.76-shared-refactor` → `demo` (PR #80, squash merge `306525d`)
**Changes:**
- New `scripts/site-reports-shared.js` (~470 lines) — factory functions extracting the helpers that had been copy-pasted between Prestart (v3.4.69) and Toolbox (v3.4.75):
  - `createPhotoController(config)` — photo upload, list render, captions, lightbox, max-N enforcement.
  - `createSignatureController(config)` — canvas-based signature pad, attendance roster, sign / unsign / clear.
  - `createOfflineQueue(config)` — localStorage-backed write queue with replay listener.
  - `injectMobileStyle(prefix)` — mobile responsive CSS, one-shot per prefix.
- `scripts/site-reports.js` — Prestart drops ~310 lines of duplicated helpers. Keeps Prestart-specific: HRCW categories, crew shape, dual-source notice.
- `scripts/toolbox.js` — Toolbox drops ~290 lines of duplicated helpers. Keeps Toolbox-specific: topic / safety_message / items_reviewed / attendance.
- Refactor lands BEFORE Diary (v3.4.77) so the third workflow starts lean.
**Status:** Live on demo. No schema or behaviour change — purely structural cleanup.

## [2026-05-14] v3.4.75 — Site Reports v2: Toolbox Talk MVP (DEMO ONLY)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/v3.4.75-toolbox` → `demo` (PR #77, squash merge `66e03a9`)
**Changes:**
- New `scripts/toolbox.js` (~810 lines) — sibling to `scripts/site-reports.js`. Photo / signature pad / offline write queue copy-pasted with `toolbox` / `_tbx` prefixes. Refactor target: extract shared helpers to `site-report-shared.js` once Daily Diary (v3) lands.
- New migration `2026-05-14_toolbox_talks_v1.sql` — `toolbox_talks` table with same RLS + realtime pattern as `prestarts`. Photos JSONB included from day 1 (Prestart needed a follow-up — not repeating).
- `permission-matrix.js` v1.2 — `reports.toolbox.{view,create,submit,sign}` added. Manager + supervisor get all four; employee / apprentice / labour_hire get `.sign` only (mirrors prestart shape).
- New sidebar entry "Toolbox" under Testing (DO NOT USE), BETA chip, next to Prestart.
- Version bump tuple: `index.html` banner + `scripts/app-state.js` `APP_VERSION` + `sw.js` CACHE all → `v3.4.75`. `sw.js` PRECACHE list includes `/scripts/toolbox.js`.
- **Migrations applied 2026-05-14 to BOTH Supabase projects:**
  - `ktmjmdzqrogauaevbktn` (eq-solves-field) ✓
  - `nspbmirochztcjijmcrx` (sks-labour) ✓ — applied per Royce's explicit "SKS live" go so Ben Ritchie can preview via `eq-solves-field.netlify.app/?tenant=sks`

**Schema differences from `prestarts` (deliberate):**
- `facilitator` (not `sks_rep`) — toolbox column names must be tenant-neutral. Prestart's `sks_rep` is a legacy leak not repeated in new tables.
- `meeting_date` / `meeting_time` (not `briefing_date` / `briefing_time`) — toolbox = scheduled meeting, not pre-shift briefing.
- `attendance` (not `crew`) — toolbox audiences include subbies, clients, visitors. Same JSONB shape as `prestarts.crew` so signature pad code is reusable.
- Toolbox-specific fields: `topic`, `safety_message`, `items_reviewed`, `open_actions`, `next_meeting`.

**Why:** Path C absorption (see `ops/decisions.md` 2026-05-13) — second workflow folded in from Ben Ritchie's `sks-field-reports.netlify.app` v29. Prestart shipped as v3.4.69; Toolbox is the second of four (Diary + Weekly to follow). Lessons applied: v3.4.54 per-action inflight guards, v3.4.55 id-coercion via `String()` for tenant-portable PKs, v3.4.56 audit failures surfaced via `console.warn` (offline queue).

**Brief drift caught:** The outstanding-build brief claimed v3.4.69 was demo's tip; reality was v3.4.74. Branch renumbered mid-session from `claude/v3.4.74-toolbox` → `claude/v3.4.75-toolbox`. The `ops/decisions.md` 2026-05-13 entry about demo version-number coordination now has two same-day events confirming the pattern (v3.4.67→v3.4.69 rebase AND v3.4.74→v3.4.75 rename).

**Status:** Live on demo (`eq-solves-field.netlify.app`) post-Netlify-deploy. Hub/dashboard restructure deferred (≥2 workflows now exist but each soaks separately first). NOT deployed to SKS prod (`sks-nsw-labour.netlify.app`) — `main` branch untouched.

## [2026-05-13] v3.4.74 — ESC-to-close on modals (accessibility quick-win)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant (Night 1 audit auto-merge)
**Branch:** `claude/audit-night1-all-angles` → `demo` then `main` (PR #73)
**Changes:**
- Global `keydown` listener added in `scripts/utils.js`. Closes only the TOP-MOST open modal per press so confirm-on-top-of-edit stacks peel back rather than blowing both away.
- Behaviour-preserving, <50 lines, no auth / no RLS change — auto-merge bar met.
**Why:** Surfaced by the Night 1 manual audit run (`AUDIT-REVIEW.md`, usability angle, FINDING #U1). Modals already closed on backdrop-click and ✕-button; ESC did nothing — standard keyboard convention violation. First step of a broader accessibility pass needed for Melbourne enterprise procurement (FINDING #U2 covers `aria-*` coverage gap).
**Status:** Live on both demo and SKS prod. 7 other audit findings opened for Royce review (see `AUDIT-REVIEW.md`).

## [2026-05-13] v3.4.73 — widen week-picker so "(this week)" no longer truncates
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/v3.4.73-week-pill-width` → `demo` then cherry-picked to `main` (PR #69)
**Changes:**
- Removed `max-width:80px` on `#globalWeek`; `<select>` now sizes to widest option (~150px).
- Mobile unaffected — `.topbar-week` still uses `flex:1`.
**Why:** SKS topbar dropdown was cutting "◉ DD.MM.YY (this week)" to "(t...s)" on prod.
**Status:** Live on both demo and SKS prod.

## [2026-05-13] v3.4.72 — skip render when polled data hasn't changed (kills flash)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/v3.4.72-skip-render-on-unchanged` → `demo` then `main` (PR #67)
**Changes:**
- New `_computeStateSignature()` builds sort-stable signature over people / managers / sites / schedule / timesheets / leaveRequests.
- `refreshData()` diffs post-load signature against last rendered; only calls `renderCurrentPage` on actual change.
- Manual ↻ Sync still renders unconditionally for visual feedback. Signature seeded after initial load so first poll doesn't fake-trigger.
**Why:** Constant flashing on SKS prod — 30-second background poll was doing full innerHTML swap unconditionally, causing scroll jump + focus drop even with no data delta.
**Status:** Live on both demo and SKS prod. Idle background poll is now a silent no-op.

## [2026-05-13] v3.4.71 — remove Project Hours panel + fix EQ→SKS logo flash
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/v3.4.70-supervisor-fixes` → `demo` then `main` (PR #64; bundled with v3.4.70)
**Changes:**
- Removed `#project-hours-panel` + script tag. Kept `scripts/project-hours.js` (parked) + `sites.track_hours` column on EQ.
- New `earlyBootBranding()` IIFE in `scripts/app-state.js` fires on DOMContentLoaded, detects slug synchronously, applies `TENANT_BRANDING` before first paint.
- `loadTenantConfig` still runs at onload for Supabase-driven access codes; `applyTenantBranding` idempotent so second call just refreshes.
**Why:** (1) Project Hours panel surfaced 'schema not applied' warnings on SKS where the migration hadn't run, added nothing useful. (2) SKS users saw EQ sky-blue logo for 200-600ms before SKS dark-blue snapped in — cause was async `loadTenantConfig()` from `window.onload` despite branding data being static per tenant.
**Status:** Live on both demo and SKS prod.

## [2026-05-13] v3.4.70 — supervisor dob/start_date + Excel date import + archive
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/v3.4.70-supervisor-fixes` → `demo` then `main` (PR #64)
**Changes:**
- `migrations/2026-05-13_managers_dob_start_date_archived.sql` adds `dob_day`, `dob_month`, `start_date`, `archived` on `managers`; `archived` on `people`. **Applied to BOTH Supabase projects on 2026-05-13.**
- `import-export.js`: `_parseCsvBirthday` now matches DD/MM/YYYY; new `_parseStartDate` handles ISO + DD/MM/YYYY + Excel serial numbers.
- Supervisor modal exposes DOB + start_date. Both filter rows get "Show archived" toggle. Active/archived render-tint + handlers wired in `managers.js` / `people.js`. Badges count active rows only.
- `supabase.js`: `saveManagerToSB` sends new columns; `savePersonToSB` sends `archived`; new `archiveManagerInSB` + `archivePersonInSB` helpers via PostgREST PATCH.
**Why:** Royce CSV review 2026-05-13 surfaced: supervisors had no DOB/start_date (people had since v3.4.16), Excel uploads rejected DD/MM/YYYY + serial dates, no reversible archive (only hard delete via `deleted_at`). Contacts↔Supervisors double-up confirmed by design (Wave 4).
**Status:** Live on both demo and SKS prod. Behaviour-preserving for existing rows.

## [2026-05-13] v3.4.69 — Site Reports module + Prestart MVP (DEMO ONLY)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/v3.4.67-prestart` → `demo` (PR #62) — rebased on top of v3.4.68 role-system, so the branch name keeps the original v3.4.67 label but the merge ships as v3.4.69. v3.4.67 was never released.
**Changes:**
- New "Site Reports" sidebar entry under "Testing (DO NOT USE)" section with BETA chip. v1 ships Prestart only — toolbox / diary / weekly follow the same pattern.
- Photos: max 8 per record, camera+gallery on mobile, resized to 1600px / JPEG-q70, stored inline as base64 in `prestarts.photos` JSONB. Lightbox + captions.
- Signature pad: HTML5 canvas modal, touch + mouse, DPR-aware. Saved as base64 PNG into `crew[i].signature_image`; idempotent re-tap preserved (v3.4.54 lesson).
- Offline write queue: `navigator.onLine` + try/catch around `sbFetch`; localStorage-backed queue replays on `'online'` event + page load. Per-tenant scoped. Visible pending pill in form footer.
- Mobile responsive: form grid collapses to 1 column < 640px; modal goes full-screen; signature canvas bumps to 260px for finger signing.
- Dual-source notice: dismissible yellow banner directing users away from `sks-field-reports.netlify.app`.
- **Migrations applied 2026-05-13 to BOTH Supabase projects:**
  - `2026-05-13_site_reports_v1.sql` — `prestarts` table + RLS + realtime
  - `2026-05-13_prestarts_photos.sql` — `ADD COLUMN photos jsonb`
**Why:** Path C absorb (see `ops/decisions.md` 2026-05-13) — workflows from Ben Ritchie's `sks-field-reports.netlify.app` v29 fold into EQ Field as a commercial sub-module. Prestart is the first of four (Toolbox / Diary / Weekly to follow). Lessons applied: v3.4.54 per-action inflight guards, v3.4.55 id-coercion for bigint/uuid PK portability, v3.4.56 audit failures surfaced via `console.warn` not silenced.
**Status:** Live on demo only (`eq-solves-field.netlify.app`). NOT deployed to SKS prod — gated on Ben Ritchie sign-off + Royce explicit go. 5 modified, 3 new files, ~1130 line diff.

## [2026-05-13] v3.4.68 — Phase B + C role system foundation (DEMO ONLY soak)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/v3.4.68-role-system-clean` → `demo` (PR #63)
**Changes:**
- `scripts/permissions.js`: new `resolveSessionRole()` (Phase C).
- Call wired into `initApp()` + supervisor PIN unlock + lock-out.
- 5 handler gates migrated to `EQ_PERMS.can()` (Phase B v1):
  - `leave.js`: `respondLeave` / `archiveLeaveRequest` / `unarchiveLeaveRequest`
  - `timesheets.js`: `fillTsWeekFromMon` / `sendTsReminder`
- All 5 perms behaviour-preserving in both supervisor + manager tiers.
- Phase A schema applied to BOTH Supabase projects on 2026-05-13.
**Why:** Royce flagged Phase B+C risk on SKS prod; chose to ship to demo this week for a 5-7 day soak before porting. PIN-unlock-wins rule preserves today's behaviour — anyone with the supervisor PIN keeps full supervisor access regardless of DB role. Phase D will tighten this server-side later (~2 weeks, planned early June).
**Status:** Demo only. SKS stays on `isManager` binary model until demo soak passes. Plan ref: `MELBOURNE-SCALE-DESIGN.md §7 Q3`.

## [2026-04-28] Add Contact button cherry-picked to main (SKS) — PR #25
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `fix/add-contact-main` → `main` (merge commit `4f03227`,
cherry-pick of `f372a43` from demo)
**Why:** Same repo Milmlow/eq-field-app; demo branch deploys to
eq-solves-field.netlify.app (EQ Field demo), main branch deploys to
sks-nsw-labour.netlify.app (SKS LIVE — ~55 staff). The button only
shipped to demo via PR #24, so SKS staff didn't get it. Cherry-pick
brings just that one-line UX fix to main without dragging the rest
of Phase 1 (flags, perms, project-hours, role enum) onto SKS.
**Status:** Merged. Netlify auto-deploy to sks-nsw-labour.netlify.app
in flight at 2026-04-28.

## [2026-04-28] Add Contact button wired into Contacts page (PR #24)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/hopeful-wright-058c8b` → `demo` (merge commit `5105517`)
**Changes:**
- `index.html` page-contacts filter row gets a "＋ Add Contact"
  button calling existing `openAddManager()` (managers.js:109).
  No new code paths — reuses the existing modal-manager + saveManager
  flow that already lived on the Supervision page.
- Both demo (SEED) and live (eq) tenants get the button — `managers`
  is in `ORG_TABLES`, not in any `TENANT_DISABLED_TABLES` entry.
- One-line diff to a single file. No JS changes, no migration, no
  permission shape change.

**Why:** The page-contacts page (nav: "Contacts" ◉) showed staff/people
but lacked an Add affordance — anyone looking for "where do I add a
contact" landed there and saw nothing. Add button only existed on
page-managers (nav: "Supervision" ☎). UX parity fix.

**Status:** Live on eq-solves-field.netlify.app post-Netlify-deploy
(~1 min after merge).

## [2026-04-27] Phase 1 implementation kickoff — flags, perms helper, migrations
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Branch:** `claude/hopeful-wright-058c8b` (not merged to demo — awaiting review)
**Changes (5 commits past `0145c78`):**
- `e9b4706` — `scripts/flags.js` PostHog feature-flag wrapper exposing
  `window.EQ_FLAGS.isEnabled()` + `variant()`. Safe defaults, no-op until
  a flag is created in the EQ PostHog project (`phc_zXpRxm6Q…`).
- `f2d0e91` — `scripts/permission-matrix.js` + `scripts/permissions.js`.
  Matrix v1 embedded as static JS; `window.EQ_PERMS.can(permKey)` reads
  the current role.
- `8b6bdb1` — Two SQL migrations written (NOT applied):
  - `migrations/2026-04-27_sites_track_hours.sql` — `track_hours` boolean
    + `budget_hours numeric` on `public.sites`
  - `migrations/2026-04-27_eq_role_enum_people_role.sql` — `eq_role`
    Postgres enum + `people.role` column with manager-table backfill
    pattern. Header includes verification queries to run before applying.
- `b367eb1` — `EQ_PERMS.getRole()` reads `window.isManager` as primary
  today-path role signal (durable for page lifetime), falling back to
  sessionStorage flags. Plan revised: 97 `isManager` references across
  `scripts/`/`index.html` rules out a wholesale refactor — strangler
  pattern instead, migrate opportunistically when touching files.
- `89f96dc` — `scripts/project-hours.js` + placeholder div before
  `</body>`. Self-mounting "Project Hours" burn-down panel — activates
  only when `feat_project_hours_v1` flag is on AND `EQ_PERMS.can('ph.view_dashboard')`
  is true. Renders per-site Budget / Used / Remaining / % used with
  colour treatment (sky / amber / red). Graceful states for "migration
  not applied yet", "no tracked sites", and network errors. Client-side
  aggregation over timesheets for v1.

**Next manual steps required (Royce):**
- Create `feat_project_hours_v1` flag in EQ PostHog project (default off,
  cohort = your `distinct_id` only)
- Apply both migrations to `ktmjmdzqrogauaevbktn` via Supabase MCP /
  Studio after running the verification queries in the role-enum header.
  Do NOT apply to `nspbmirochztcjijmcrx` (SKS live).
- Open PR `claude/hopeful-wright-058c8b` → `demo` when ready to merge.

**Status:** Code shipped to feature branch only. No Netlify deploy. No
Supabase changes. SKS Labour untouched.

## [2026-04-27] Multi-tenancy + dev-workflow plan locked (planning only, no code shipped)
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Changes:**
- Living plan document captured at
  `eq-solves-field/.claude/worktrees/hopeful-wright-058c8b/MULTI-TENANCY-PLAN.md`.
- Three strategic decisions locked:
  - Sprint scope = Phase 1 only (PostHog flags + project-hours feature + 5-tier
    role system). Phase 2 deferred to first self-serve trial signup OR ~3
    customers manually provisioned.
  - Tenancy lives inside `ktmjmdzqrogauaevbktn` only; SKS Labour
    (`nspbmirochztcjijmcrx`) untouched.
  - Auth: Supabase-native JWT minted in `verify-pin.js` with
    `app_metadata.tenant_id` and `app_metadata.eq_role`; PIN UX preserved.
- Tenant URL convention locked: `eq.solutions/field/<slug>/`. Path-based slug
  resolution, single shared Netlify site, no subdomains.
- 5-tier role system designed (`manager > supervisor > employee > apprentice >
  labour_hire`) with `eq_role` Postgres enum and `people.role` column.
- Single PIN per tenant on `organisations.tenant_pin`; per-role PIN env var
  pattern dropped.
- Permission matrix HTML built at
  `eq-context/eq/field/permissions/permission-matrix.html` plus v1
  JSON snapshot at `permissions-by-role-v1.json` (manager 56 / supervisor 36 /
  employee 13 / apprentice 17 / labour_hire 5).
- First PostHog flag designed: `feat_project_hours_v1` gates new project-hours
  burn-down feature with `sites.track_hours` + `sites.budget_hours`.

**Status:** Plan complete. No code touched. Phase 1 implementation pending
explicit Royce go-ahead.

## [2026-04-05] Demo Mode, Seed Data and Network Error Suppression
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Changes:**
- Demo mode implemented - bypasses Supabase auth when tenant slug is eq
- 18 generic staff, 7 generic sites, 5 weeks of schedule seeded
- Network error toasts suppressed in demo mode
- Cowork guardrail issue documented
**Status:** Live on eq-solves-field.netlify.app (demo branch)

## [2026-04-05] Cloudflare Pages Deployment Architecture Locked
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Changes:**
- Deployment architecture confirmed and locked
- Rule: never cross-deploy between targets
**Status:** Architecture documented

## [2026-04-04] Redundancy and Failover Gap Assessment
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Changes:**
- Full infrastructure assessment across Netlify, Supabase, Resend, GitHub
- Gaps identified: Supabase single point of failure, no backups, no tagged release
**Status:** Gaps identified - NOT yet resolved

## [2026-03-31] White-Label Commercialisation Review
**Built by:** Royce Milmlow + assistant
**Changes:**
- EQ Field Ops commercialisation roadmap built (85-item Excel workbook)
- White-label conversion estimated at 2-3 hours
**Status:** Planning complete - not yet executed

## 2026-07-11
- v3.5.299 (PR #455) — Sidebar: hide the orphaned "Pipeline" section header in employee view. The section wrapper was ungated while all three children (Pipeline/Resources/Accounts) are manager-only, so employee logins saw an empty "Pipeline" label. Marked `#nav-section-pipeline` `.edit-only` + added a matching `.nav-section.edit-only` CSS rule. Live.

## 2026-07-13
- v3.5.312 (PR #472) — Mobile reflow slice 2: Dashboard "Site Breakdown — Per Day", Job Numbers table, and Leave calendar reflow onto the `.eqf-mcard` phone-card primitive (no more 375px side-scroll). Live.
- v3.5.311 (PR #471) — Mobile: `overflow-x: clip` body guard (≤768px + shell-mode) so a single wide child can't make the whole page side-scroll. `clip` chosen over `hidden` to preserve sticky headers + fixed nav. Live.
- v3.5.310 (PR #470) — Mobile reflow slice 1: introduced the shared `.eqf-mcard` stacked-row card primitive (styles/mobile.css) and migrated Timesheets `.ts-mcard`, Contacts mobile cards, and Leave `.eq-lv-wcard` onto it (no behaviour change). Home `.eqh-tile` token-aligned CSS-only (kept as a launcher tile). Live.

## 2026-07-13
- v3.5.307 (PR #467) — fixed Core→Field login ("could not connect to this workspace" on every load). eq-shell's control-plane column-scope migration had stripped tenant routing secrets from anon on jvkn; Field now resolves routing server-side via netlify/functions/tenant-config.js (service role, tenant from the signed #sh= token). No anon re-grant.
- v3.5.309 (PR #469) — mobile nav + home respect security groups: bottom nav / drawer / home tiles gated via EQ_PERMS (new applyMobileNavPerms + home.js tile gating) so labour_hire no longer sees Leave/Roster/Team/Contacts it can't action.
- v3.5.310 (PR #470) — shared .eqf-mcard phone-card primitive; 3 bespoke card impls migrated onto it.
- v3.5.311 (PR #471) — overflow-x: clip page-scroll guard (html/body) so a stray over-wide child can't side-scroll the whole page on a phone.
- v3.5.312 (PR #472) — Dashboard / Job Numbers / Leave-calendar reflowed onto .eqf-mcard for phones. All shipped to field.eq.solutions + verified live.
- v3.5.314 (PR #474) — mobile device-pass polish, 7 fixes: dropped the ◉ glyph on the "this week" week-picker option; **root-caused the stuck "↑ Saving…" pill** (a 4xx write threw without releasing `_pendingWriteCount` → hung forever; now cleared + 15s watchdog); week-nav "‹ prev" no longer jumps across gaps (picker seeds a symmetric ±16-week contiguous window — prev is the real previous week); Labour Hire stat-card wrench→hard-hat; removed the Timesheets helper paragraph; hid the EQ Agent FAB; retired the Prestart dual-source banner. Live on field.eq.solutions.

## 2026-07-13 (cont.)
- v3.5.315 (PR #475) — Mobile: finished migrating the home launcher tiles (`.eqh-tile`) onto the shared `.eqf-mcard` primitive (markup carries the class; home.css keeps only tile-specific layout). No visual change; completes the phone-card unification (all 4 envelopes now on one primitive). Live.
- v3.5.316 (PR #476, merged `ca41c56`, live) — mobile drawer icons → consistent Lucide. The slide-up hamburger menu mixed geometric Unicode (◈ ⬡ ◉ ◎) + colour emoji (☎ 🏖 🛡 👥) — misleading on a phone (Supervision=telephone, Leave=beach/boat, Contacts=dot). All 21 `.d-icon` swapped for inline Lucide SVGs (new `.d-icon svg` rule mirrors `.mnav-icon svg`); `stroke:currentColor` so icons tint with row state. Manager-lock toggles lock⇄lock-open via innerHTML. Rebased through a version collision with #475 (which took v3.5.315) → re-stamped v3.5.316. Live-verified on field.eq.solutions.
- v3.5.326 (PR #486) — mobile: pin form actions (sticky `.modal-footer` on ≤768px + Prestart action row) so Submit/Save don't scroll off a tall phone form.
- v3.5.327 (PR #487) — mobile: reusable skeleton loaders (`eqSkeleton()` + `.eqf-skel*`); Dashboard loading shimmers instead of a bare ⏳; roster Job Numbers empty gets icon + action.
- v3.5.328 (PR #488) — mobile gestures: timesheets swipe-to-change-week (mirrors roster) + pull-to-refresh (passive, guarded, fixed pill; interacts with v3.5.317's native-reload suppression — complementary).
- v3.5.329 (PR #489) — timesheets: one-tap "Prefill week" for a worker's OWN draft week (was supervisor-only). Precedence roster → last week; own row, empty days only, never overwrites, editable, hidden once submitted.

- PR #492 (merged `8142119`, live on field.eq.solutions) — Forecast page's sticky "Project" column header set `background:var(--surface)` inline without resetting `color`, inheriting `color:white` from base.css's `thead tr` rule → invisible white-on-white text at every viewport width. Fixed by adding `color:var(--navy)`. Found while auditing the whole app for the same pattern that broke SKS's mobile Weekly Roster header; no other page reproduces it.
- PR #493 (merged `48d29f1`, live on field.eq.solutions) — Leave calendar's weekday header (`leave.js`) left its `th` background transparent, letting the unstyled `thead tr`'s navy show through under dark ink-3/ink-4 text — low-contrast, opposite direction of #492's bug. Matched to `calendar.js`'s already-correct identical header by adding `background:var(--surface-2)`. Pipeline import preview has the same pattern, left as-is (not used on mobile).
- PR #494 (merged `6b446cd`, live on field.eq.solutions, v3.5.330) — SKS Pipeline manual-remove: `discardJob`/`removeProject` gated to managers + audit-logged (previously open to anyone, silent). New "Show archived" list with Restore. New "Delete permanently" (manager-gated, confirm, audit-logged, only reachable from the archived list) — hard-deletes a tender plus its cascading nominations/pending_schedule/tender_enrichment; `tender_review_decisions` cleared explicitly first (no CASCADE FK). DB: applied a matching anon-delete policy on `tender_review_decisions` in the SKS-live database.
- PR #495 (merged `32e192f`, live on field.eq.solutions, v3.5.331) — "Load sample data" on Pipeline/Resource Allocation/Account Explorer: in-browser-only fake dataset (12 tenders) for demoing the feature to the EQ team without touching real SKS data. New `scripts/sks-pipeline-demo.js`; both pages' `_load()` short-circuit to it when active; `sbFetch` gains a scoped write-blocking short-circuit (SKS-pipeline tables, non-GET, demo flag) as a backstop across 20+ write call-sites. Persistent banner + one-click exit.

## 2026-07-19
- PR #496 (merged `b3c7b04`, live) — access-model cluster 3 client-side gating: `field.manage_roster`/`field.manage_licences`/`field.manage_labour_hire` (`@eq-solutions/roles` v2.5.3). Roster/Teams write functions moved off the coarse `isManager` boolean onto the granular key (also closed a real gap — 3 team-write functions had no guard of their own); licence + hire-company fields in the Person modal sub-gated at the field level, since neither is a separate feature in this codebase.
- PR #497 (merged `13d210d`, live) — server-side enforcement for the same 3 keys: hardened RLS on `schedule_entries` (roster) + permission checks inside the `field_teams_iud`/`field_team_members_iud`/`field_people_iud` `SECURITY DEFINER` triggers (which bypass base-table RLS entirely, so the check has to live in the function body).
- PR #498 (merged `af9b1d5`, live) — restored a lost `authenticated` grant on 6 `app_data.field_*` views; not live-breaking today (current write paths route around them) but a landmine if that routing ever changes.
- PR #499 (merged `c9a30c4`, live, verified with a real write test) — `field_people_iud`'s labour-hire guard was reverting `agency` but not the separate `hire_company` column on an unauthorized edit; any Field session could set it via a direct API call. Fixed with the same revert pattern.
