## ⏩ Session close — 2026-07-01 (eq-cards part ii) — onboarding UX polish + activation moments + spinner fix

**Completed (eq-cards, deployed):**
- [x] **Android camera/gallery** — `FirstScanScreen` rewritten: explicit "Take a photo" + "Upload from album" buttons popping `ImageSource` directly; pops null for "Set up later". Bypasses OS routing ambiguity. Worker ID card hidden on empty wallet; `_IllustrationEmpty` CTAs moved to top. `_captureFlow` accepts `{ImageSource? source}`. Commit `493d895`, run 28511411215. _(done 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **First-licence success sheet** — one-time bottom sheet on first credential saved: checkmark, "You're ready for site.", employer context if connected. `eq_cards.first_licence_shown` pref gate. Commit `1a141a6`, run 28512783582. _(done 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **Connection confirmation** — one-time snackbar "Connected to [Org]" on first non-personal tenant activation (post claim/join). `eq_cards.last_known_tenant` pref gate per slug. _(done 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **PostHog `signup_completed` fix** — fires only when `user.createdAt` within 5 min (new user only); method corrected `'email'` → `'phone'`. _(done 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **iOS spinner fix** — `CircularProgressIndicator.adaptive` replaced with plain `CircularProgressIndicator(color: ...)` in `EqButton` + `NotProvisionedScreen`. `.adaptive` on iOS web → `CupertinoActivityIndicator` which ignores `valueColor` and may not animate in HTML renderer. _(done 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **Worker card to bottom** — non-empty wallet ListView: `_WalletIdCard` moved from top to after all licence tiles with `EqSpacing.lg` gap above. Credentials visible immediately on open. Commit `9f2b408`, run 28513226954. _(done 2026-07-01)_

**Deferred:** none.

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-07-01 (eq-shell part j) — staff-resync-licences + MobileSheet parity

**Completed (eq-shell, branch `claude/worker-dedup-archive-lockdown`):**
- [x] **`netlify/functions/staff-resync-licences.ts`** (new) — POST; re-syncs licences from jvkn `public.licences` → ehow `app_data.licences` for a staff member who uploaded licences after their approval event. Manager-gated (`admin.review_cards`). Looks up `cards_worker_id` server-side, resolves `workers.user_id`, fetches `public.licences` (same filter as `cards-approve-staff`), upserts with `ON CONFLICT cards_credential_id DO NOTHING` + `.select()` so `synced` count = rows actually inserted (not just found). Returns `{ ok, synced }`. _(done 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **`SplitPanel.tsx`** — "Re-sync from Cards" button in the empty-licences state; `handleResync`; inline result message; `onLicencesResynced` prop → `handleMutated`. State resets on staff selection change. _(done 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **`StaffPage.tsx` `MobileSheet`** — same button + handler + prop for mobile parity. _(done 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **Build clean** — `pnpm run build` passes, 0 type errors. _(done 2026-07-01)_

**Deferred:** none.

---

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-07-01 (eq-shell) — SMS approval notification + StaffPage Phase E

**Completed (eq-shell, pushed + deployed):**
- [x] **SMS worker on connection approval** — `cards-approve-staff.ts`: fire-and-forget `sendSms` on both invite path (`staffRow.phone`) and application path (`workerPhone`). 24h guard against retroactive batch approvals. Tenant name fetched inline for invite path. Non-fatal — approval committed before SMS fires. Commit `2720f49`, deployed. _(done 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **PR #585 merged** — StaffPage Phase E: `MatrixView.tsx`, `SplitPanel.tsx`, `staffHelpers.ts`, `staffTypes.ts` extracted to `src/pages/staff/` sub-modules. StaffPage.tsx 2252→~300 lines net; all CI green (tsc + 94 tests pass); fast-forward to main, deployed. _(done 2026-07-01)_

**Deferred:** none.

---

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-07-01 (eq-cards part h) — onboarding activation: first-scan screen + rich empty state

**Completed (eq-cards, pushed to main; deploy pending):**
- [x] **`FirstScanScreen` built** — new `lib/features/onboarding/first_scan_screen.dart`. Full-screen dark modal (ink bg) with animated mock card, "Add your first credential" headline, "Scan now" → pops `true` to launch capture flow, "Set up later" → pops `false`. Shown once via `SharedPreferences` flag `eq_cards.first_scan_shown`. Commit `37f8eb3`. _(done 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **`LicencesListScreen` wired** — postFrameCallback triggers `_maybeShowFirstScan()` when `items.isEmpty && !_firstScanLaunched`. Wallet empties → first-login screen fires on next frame. _(done 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **Rich empty state** — `_EmptyState` + `_IllustrationEmpty` accept `orgName`. Headline: "Your digital wallet is empty". Non-Personal tenants get employer context: "`<OrgName>` checks your credentials are current — add them now so you're ready for site." Commit `37f8eb3`. _(done 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **Option C task chip spawned** — employer SMS on worker connection approval (Shell repo) — separate worktree chip created. _(done 2026-07-01)_

**Deferred (added 2026-07-01):**
- [x] **Deploy eq-cards** — onboarding activation (first-scan screen + rich empty state). Run 28509766188, 2m29s. _(done 2026-07-01)_

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-07-01 (eq-service) — instruments decoupled from assets

**Completed:**
- [x] **Migration 0164 applied** — dropped `canonical_id`/`canonical_synced_at` from `app_data.instruments`, rebuilt `service.instruments` view + INSTEAD OF trigger. Reverses the incorrect 0158 asset wiring.
- [x] **`pullCanonicalInstrumentsAction` removed** — was pulling from `app_data.assets WHERE asset_type='plant_equipment'` (wrong source). Action + "Sync from Shell" button gone from instruments module.

- [x] **Migration 0165 applied** — `instrument_id uuid FK` added to `app_data.acb_tests` + `app_data.nsx_tests`. Rebuilt `service.acb_tests` + `service.nsx_tests` views and INSTEAD OF trigger functions.
- [x] **ACB/NSX instrument picker built** — Step 1 of both workflows now shows a dropdown populated from the instruments register (active, ordered by name, shows serial number). `instrument_id` wired through page → client wrapper → workflow → action.
- [x] **Types + actions updated** — `AcbTest`, `NsxTest` gain `instrument_id: string | null`; `updateAcbDetailsAction` + `updateNsxDetailsAction` accept `instrument_id`. tsc 0 errors.
- [x] **Committed** — 14 files, commit `042aa66` on `claude/heuristic-goldberg-ae3086`.

**Deferred:** none.

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-07-01 (eq-cards) — signup 500 + error copy + photo picker + worker dedup

**Completed (eq-cards, pushed to main; deploy pending):**
- [x] **Migration 0066 — `handle_phone_dedup` SECURITY DEFINER** — ALL new signups 500ing since 0065 landed. Trigger ran as `authenticator` → `permission denied for schema shell_control`. Applied live to jvkn + committed. _(fixed 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **Auth error copy** — "No internet connection" → "Unable to connect…" + Sentry capture for NetworkFailure. `AuthRetryableFetchException` also fires on 5xx, not just true offline. (commit `60de9d1`) _(fixed 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **Android photo picker** — `pickImageWithSourceChoice` helper: bottom sheet on web (Take a photo / Choose from library). Applied to licences list, licence edit, certificates. (commit `f42376e`) _(fixed 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **Migration 0067 — `eq_cards_upsert_my_worker` orphan adoption** — profile-save was creating duplicate workers when admin pre-created a shell (`user_id=null`). Now calls `eq_cards_link_or_create_worker` first. Applied live + committed. _(fixed 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **William Brown orphan row deleted** — `61691bf9` (admin shell, no licences). Kept `650f0a4b` (auth-linked). _(done 2026-07-01)_

**Deferred (added 2026-07-01):**
- [x] **Deploy eq-cards** — deployed run 28489589899, succeeded 2m41s. _(done 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **Sweep workers table for orphan/duplicate workers** — 0 phone dupes, 0 email dupes; 4 at-risk orphans found and resolved (migration 0068 applied live 2026-07-01): John Angangan orphan deleted, Cicero/Zemi/Marcus proactively linked. _(done 2026-07-01)_

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-07-01 (part c) — Warm Sand migration + Phase D + PDF import fixes

**Completed (eq-shell, merged + deployed):**
- [x] **Warm Sand neutrals — DONE desktop + mobile.** PR #580 (StaffPage pilot) + #581 (repo-wide .tsx, 242/21 files) + #582 (CSS + mobile chrome: MobileTabBar/Drawer + App/comms/gm-reports/CoreHome, 121 refs). Cool-slate → `--eq-gray` warm ramp; brand + status unchanged.
- [x] **StaffPage Phase D — PR #578** — pure logic → `staff/staffLib.ts` + 9 tests (suite 85→94). Phase E now test-guarded/unblocked.
- [x] **PDF import fixes — PR #584** — real Loader2 spinner + auto-apply default markup on both PDF paths (were markup:'' rate=cost). Forward-only: the already-imported quote needs markup set on its existing lines.

**Deferred (added 2026-07-01):**
- [ ] **Semantics pass** (Warm Sand) — reds/greens/ambers + status-chip pastels shift shade → needs a before/after sign-off; unblocks flipping the lint no-raw-hex ratchet (F) _(needs Royce's call) (added 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **StaffPage Phase E** — extract MatrixView/SplitPanel into staff/ modules (now Phase-D-test-guarded) _(done 2026-07-01 — PR #585 merged)_
- [ ] **Token source unification (A)** + eslint-runnable env — eslint won't run in the work checkout, blocking a lint-config change / the blocking ratchet _(added 2026-07-01)_


## ⏩ Session close — 2026-07-01 (part b) — Forecasts tab: manual "mark done"

**Completed (eq-shell, PR #583 merged `16fabd3`, deployed):**
- [x] **GM Reports forecasts tab — per-job "Mark done" self-report.** The tab derived "done" only from the Workbench import (lags); PMs can now mark a forecast done manually (optimistic, undoable). Done = derived OR manually marked; counts/progress honour both. Mirrors the gm-invoice-run pattern: `0153_gm_forecast_status.sql` (`app_data.gm_forecast_status` on ehow, keyed period_id+job_code, tenant RLS + grants), `gm-forecast-status.ts` (GET/PATCH, reports.view-gated), `ForecastView` UI. tsc + 94 tests green.

**Royce action (activates persistence):**
- [ ] **Dispatch `tenant-migrate.yml`** (workflow_dispatch, `sks` slug, production-gated, `allow_checksum_drift=true` per usual) to apply **0153** to ehow. Until then the Mark-done buttons render but a click reverts (table absent → PATCH 500s). _(added 2026-07-01)_

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-07-01 (part f) — EQ Ops: material markup default + rate library sticky

**Completed (eq-shell, committed to worktree `quirky-cerf-fbbdb9`):**
- [x] **`QuotesSetup.tsx` `DEFAULT_CONFIG.material_markup`** changed from `"15"` → `"10"` — fallback shown in Setup → Rates when no DB config exists
- [x] **`QuotesModule.tsx` PDF import paths** (3 locations) — `confirmPdfImport`, `handlePdfFileStart`, header-parse result: all now inherit `defaultMaterialMarkup` (loaded from `eq_get_pricing_config`, i.e. rate library setting); sell rate computed as `cost × (1 + markup%)` instead of `= supplier_price`
- [x] **Labour markup untouched** — `addLineItem("labour")` still returns `""` per Royce decision

**Decided:**
- Labour markup stays blank/separate — labour rates are priced differently
- Material/subcontractor/one-off line items should inherit the rate library's markup value
- The "sticky" flow already existed via `eq_get_pricing_config` → `defaultMaterialMarkup`; only PDF imports were bypassing it

**Deferred:** none.

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-07-01 (part g) — Netlify env cleanup

**Completed:**
- [x] **`EQ_FIELD_HANDOFF_KEY` deleted from Netlify** — Field HMAC handoff dead since JWT migration; confirmed no live consumer. Done via Netlify MCP. _(done 2026-07-01)_

**Completed (continued):**
- [x] **`VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` set + `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` deleted** — Royce created a new Maps API key (eq-cards GCP project, HTTP referrer restricted to core.eq.solutions/* + *.netlify.app/*); set via Netlify MCP. _(done 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **PR #579 merged** — Sentry fixes (approval dedup, Cards timer, PDF fetch catch) squash-merged after rebase. Deployed. _(done 2026-07-01)_

---

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-07-01 (part e) — Sentry triage + 3 fixes + branch cleanup

**Completed (eq-shell):**
- [x] **Sentry EQ-SHELL-E fixed** — `cards_field_approvals` `.insert()` → `.upsert()` with `onConflict: 'staff_id,tenant_id', ignoreDuplicates: true` on both invite and application paths. Re-approving a previously-approved staff member was 23505ing. → PR #579
- [x] **Sentry EQ-SHELL-F fixed** — `CardsIframe` 30s load-timeout: added `activeRef` guard inside callback to handle React cleanup race when user navigates away before timer fires. → PR #579
- [x] **Sentry EQ-SHELL-J fixed** — `handleDownloadPdf` had `try/finally` but no `catch`; Mobile Safari `fetch` throws `TypeError: Load failed` → leaked as unhandled rejection. Added catch → `setPdfErr`. → PR #579
- [x] **Sentry EQ-SHELL-A/B ignored (forever)** — same iOS Safari session (2026-06-29), identical trace, simultaneous Field+Service timeout — iOS backgrounding killed network. Not a code bug.
- [x] **Sentry EQ-SHELL-8 ignored (forever)** — Chrome DevTools Protocol extension message, no stacktrace, not app code.
- [x] **`claude/field-deep-link` deleted** — local + remote. Feature already shipped in PR #571 (`80c904c`).

**Deferred (added 2026-07-01):**
- [x] **Merge PR #579** — merged 2026-07-01. _(done)_
- [x] **Netlify: rename `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` → `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY`** — done 2026-07-01 (new key created + set). _(done)_
- [x] **Netlify: delete `EQ_FIELD_HANDOFF_KEY`** — deleted 2026-07-01 (Field HMAC handoff dead since JWT migration). `EQ_FIELD_HANDOFF_KEY_NEXT`/`EQ_SECRET_SALT_NEXT` were never set. `EQ_SECRET_SALT` must NOT be removed — still the active session-signing fallback in `token.ts`. _(done 2026-07-01)_

---

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-07-01 (part c) — Dead cert-parse removed + main build-outage navigated

**Completed (eq-shell, merged):**
- [x] **PR #572 merged** (`003aad4`) — removed dead synchronous `cert-import-parse.ts` (superseded by the #563 background + upload-URL flow); corrected the panel flow comment. Ticks the part-b deferred "remove dead cert-import-parse.ts".
- [x] **Unblocked the cert-import fix deploy** — #563 had been stuck because `main` was build-broken; once main went green, #563 + #572 deployed. Prod verified alive (`verify-shell-session` → 401).

**Build-outage navigated (resolved by a concurrent agent; converged):**
- `main` was build-red — two type errors in `cards-approve-staff.ts` (missing `rejection_reason` destructure + a `PostgrestBuilder→Promise` cast that needed `as unknown as`). Fixed by **#571** + **#576** (concurrent agent). My redundant 1-line hotfix **#574 was closed**. Lesson: don't race main-unblock when another agent is already on it.

**Decided (Royce):** when main is build-broken, prefer a minimal build-unblock over merging a feature-bundled fix (#571 bundled field-deep-linking). (In the end the concurrent agent's split fixes landed first.)

**Deferred (added 2026-07-01):**
- [x] **Enabled "Require branches to be up to date before merging"** on `main` branch protection (`required_status_checks.strict=true`, both required checks preserved). **Verified working** — a throwaway PR from a branch 3 behind main returned `mergeStateStatus: BEHIND` and merge was refused ("head branch is not up to date with the base branch"). This is the gate that would have caught today's interleaved-merge outage. _(done 2026-07-01)_

---

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-07-01 (part d) — eq-shell PR batch: URL-per-tab + tsc fixes + cleanup

**Completed (eq-shell, all merged):**
- [x] **PR #571 merged** (`80c904c`) — URL-per-tab Shell side (superseded #573) + rejection_reason type fix. `buildFieldSrc`/`buildFieldCookieSrc` + `FieldIframe` postMessage listener + `history.pushState`.
- [x] **PR #576 merged** — `PostgrestBuilder as unknown as Promise<...>` one-line tsc hotfix. Main was broken at `cards-approve-staff.ts:131` (direct cast introduced by PR #568); unblocked all remaining PRs.
- [x] **PR #570 merged** — Google Maps key prefix fix + dead `NETLIFY_CONTEXT` Sentry fallback removed.
- [x] **PR #572 merged** — Removed dead `cert-import-parse.ts` (old sync parser, superseded by async background fn).
- [x] **PR #575 merged** — Training matrix: filter by employment type, sort columns, multi-select, column width fixes.
- [x] **PR #573 closed** (duplicate of #571); **PR #574 closed** (duplicate type fix).

**Decided:**
- `as T` direct cast from `PostgrestBuilder` is invalid — must go through `as unknown as T`. Pattern to follow in future.

**Deferred:** none.

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-07-01 (eq-field) — Edge fn canonical deploy + URL-per-tab Field side

**Completed (eq-field, merged + deployed):**
- [x] **PR #380 merged** — v3.5.216: 4 edge functions rewritten for canonical `app_data.*` schema (ehow compatibility). `supervisor-digest`, `ts-reminder`, `tafe-weekly-fill`, `shift-events` all replaced `public.schedule` / `public.people` queries with `app_data.schedule_entries` / `app_data.field_people`.
- [x] **All 4 edge functions deployed to ehow** (`ehowgjardagevnrluult`) — none existed there before this session. Status: `ACTIVE` on all 4 post-deploy.
- [x] **`ts_reminders_sent` migration applied to ehow** — required by `ts-reminder`; confirmed applied.
- [x] **PR #381 merged** — v3.5.217: URL-per-tab Field side. `showPage()` emits `EQ_TAB_CHANGE` postMessage `{ type: 'EQ_TAB_CHANGE', tab: <slug> }` to `https://core.eq.solutions`; `initApp()` reads `?tab=` deep-link param and applies after role routing.

**Decided:**
- All user access is via Shell iframe — no direct field.eq.solutions users. URL-per-tab lives at Shell level; Field only needs postMessage emission + `?tab=` read.
- `supervisor-digest-v2` never existed on ehow (CLAUDE.md reference stale). Deployed as `supervisor-digest` v1 slug.

**Deferred (added 2026-07-01):**
- [ ] **Add `TENANT_UUID = 7dee117c-98bd-4d39-af8c-2c81d02a1e85` to ehow edge function secrets** — Supabase dashboard → Project Settings → Edge Functions → Secrets. All 4 functions 500 without it. _(Royce action) (added 2026-07-01)_
- [ ] **Update pg_cron digest cron URL** — check ehow pg_cron; if referencing `supervisor-digest-v2`, update to `supervisor-digest`. _(added 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **Shell-side URL-per-tab PR** — PR #571 merged 2026-07-01 (`80c904c`). `buildFieldSrc`/`buildFieldCookieSrc` accept `tab` param; `FieldIframe` reads `?tab=` on mount + listens for `EQ_TAB_CHANGE` → `history.pushState`. _(done 2026-07-01)_

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-30 (ARMADA on eq-intake) — pre-bake + 4 clean fleet cycles

**Completed (eq-intake / repo `eq-solutions/eq-solves-intake`, all merged to main):**
- [x] **Pre-baked ARMADA** (PR #45) — vendored 10 skills + scripts into main checkout `.claude/` (local-only, gitignored + `.git/info/exclude`), `.armada/config.json` + `SETUP-NOTES.md`, 10 `armada*`/`fleet-defect` labels. Mirrors the eq-service pre-bake.
- [x] **Cycle 1 — PR #48 (#47)** — eq-confirm-ui tests resolved `@eq/intake` via gitignored/stale `dist`; added vitest `resolve.alias` → `@eq/*` source (green from fresh checkout, no build), an `augment()` dependency-surface guard that surfaces missing exports instead of silently degrading, fixed 2 masked type errors in `FlaggedRowsTable.tsx` (the #13 `ai_enrichment`/`duplicate` flag kinds), + a regression test. 58 tests pass.
- [x] **Cycle 2 — PR #50 (#49)** — fleet gate was `pnpm -C eq-platform check` over the whole workspace (red on stale `apps/*`). Added `check:packages` script; pointed `.armada/config.json` `commands.build` at it.
- [x] **Cycle 3 — PR #51 (#46)** — **removed stale `apps/eq-service` + `apps/eq-shell`** (675 files) + dropped `apps/*` from `pnpm-workspace.yaml` + pruned lockfile. Investigation: PHASE-0 monorepo migration was abandoned (its Maximo-demo driver is parked); real apps ship from their own standalone repos. Full-workspace `check` is green again.
- [x] **Polish — PR #52** — doc-rot follow-through: superseded banner on `PHASE-0-EQ-SERVICE-MONOREPO-MIGRATION.md`; fixed stale `apps/eq-shell/.env.local` ref in `EQ-TENANCY-MODEL.md`.

**Decided (Royce):** set ARMADA up on eq-intake; hand-merge the cycle output as it goes; on #46, investigate-then-remove the app duplicates (not fix); wrap polishing once library verified clean.

**Deferred (added 2026-06-30):**
- [ ] **Arm crows-nest `/loop` on eq-intake** — 4 clean manual cycles now observed; still needs `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` (plugin install, or `export CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT=.claude/armada`) + Royce's go _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **Add `test:` gate** to eq-intake `.armada/config.json` (e.g. `pnpm -C eq-platform test`) — unit tests green across packages, just not wired into the fleet gate yet _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **(optional, needs your call)** Harden build-before-test workspace-wide so the stale-dist bug class (root of #47) can't recur — source-resolution or build-ordering across all packages _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **(optional, needs your taste)** Archive stale root planning docs (`PLAN-*`, `OVERNIGHT-REVIEW-*`, `CONDUIT-AUDIT-*`) into `_archive/` _(added 2026-06-30)_

**Notes (load-bearing):**
- eq-intake has **no root `package.json`** — the pnpm workspace lives in `eq-platform/`; fleet gate = `pnpm -C eq-platform check:packages`. No CI workflows in the repo.
- Vendored ARMADA skills are **local-only in the main checkout** `C:\Projects\eq-intake\.claude\` — run ARMADA from a session rooted at the repo root, NOT a `*-wt` worktree, or `/lighthouse` etc. won't resolve.
- PHASE-0 monorepo migration is **abandoned**; `apps/eq-service`/`apps/eq-shell` are gone from eq-intake. eq-service = `eq-solves-service` repo, eq-shell = `eq-shell` repo (live, shipping daily).

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-07-01 (part b) — Cert-import 500 root-caused + fixed (async payload wall)

**Completed (eq-shell, MERGED + deploying):**
- [x] **PR #563 merged** (`b729eed`) — calibration cert import "Import failed (500): Internal Error. ID: …" fixed. **Root cause:** `cert-import-parse-background` is a `-background` function → Netlify invokes it **asynchronously**, and the async (Lambda) event-payload limit is ~256 KB vs 6 MB synchronous. The panel POSTed multipart PDF **bytes** → platform rejected the invocation **before the handler ran** (zero handler logs in 24h, confirmed via `netlify logs`; the `01KW…` ID is a Netlify request id, not Sentry). The async rework (#509) fixed the 26s timeout but introduced this wall — 7th in the #506–#535 cert-import-500 chain.
- [x] **Fix:** browser uploads each PDF via the proven **synchronous** `upload-asset-cert` (5-wide pool), then hands the background parser only JSON `{ files:[{url,fileName}] }`. Parser **fetches bytes server-side** (no payload limit) with an SSRF guard (only fetches our `SUPABASE_URL` origin). Parse-time URLs cached + reused at commit → each PDF uploads once, not per row.
- [x] Verified: `build:packages` + `tsc -b` (functions covered via `tsconfig.netlify.json`) + eslint on both files — clean.

**Deferred (added 2026-07-01):**
- [x] **Remove dead `cert-import-parse.ts`** — removed in PR #573 (bundled with field deep-link PR) _(done 2026-07-01)_
- [ ] **Verify cert import live** — once deploy goes green, import multiple certs at core.eq.solutions (hard-refresh for new panel JS); parser now writes a real failure reason to job status if a download fails _(added 2026-07-01)_

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-07-01 — Pending connections audit + 3 gap fixes

**Completed (eq-shell, merged):**
- [x] **PR #565 merged** (`8987990`) — training matrix full licence names in column headers + mobile polish (pending cards layout, employment type labels, iOS safe-area footer)
- [x] **PR #567 merged** — blank name fix: `staff-pending-connections.ts` falls back to `app_data.staff` on ehow by phone for workers with null names in `public.workers`
- [x] **PR #568 merged** — pending connections: worker rejection email (application path), rejection reason written to `org_access_requests.note`, phone suffix lookup bug fixed
- [x] **Migration `2026_07_01_org_access_requests_notification.sql`** — `notification_sent_at` column added to `org_access_requests` on jvkn (reserved; notify-connection-request edge fn handles actual notifications)

**Decided:**
- Admin notifications already live via `notify-connection-request` Supabase Edge Function (pg_net trigger on INSERT to `org_access_requests`). Bidirectional (worker→employer + employer→worker). Do not duplicate in eq-shell.

**Deferred (added 2026-07-01):**
- [x] **Invite-path rejection email** — `cards_field_approvals` reject now notifies the worker; PR #569 merged 2026-07-01 _(done 2026-07-01)_

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-07-01 (part c) — Field iframe URL-per-tab deep linking (eq-shell PR #573)

**Completed (eq-shell, merged):**
- [x] **PR #571 merged** (`80c904c`) — Shell-side URL-per-tab deep linking. `buildFieldSrc`/`buildFieldCookieSrc` accept optional `tab` param; `FieldIframe` reads `?tab=` from Shell URL on mount, listens for `EQ_TAB_CHANGE` postMessages (origin-validated), calls `history.pushState`. `pickTenant` clears `?tab=` on workspace switch. Also included rejection_reason type fix. PR #573 was a duplicate — closed in favour of #571.

**Deferred (added 2026-07-01):**
- [x] **eq-field matching PR** — DONE: v3.5.217 (PR #381, merged 2026-07-01). `showPage()` emits `EQ_TAB_CHANGE` postMessage; `initApp()` reads `?tab=` on load _(done 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **Merge + smoke PR #573** — #573 closed (duplicate); #571 was the actual implementation, merged 2026-07-01 _(done 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **Clean up `fix/remove-dead-cert-parse` local branch** — remote deleted with `--delete-branch` on #571 merge _(done 2026-07-01)_

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-30 (eq-field) — zaap worker-PII anon-grant revoke (defense-in-depth)

**Completed (eq-field, merged + applied live):**
- [x] **PR #379 merged** (`18b17b8`) — `REVOKE ALL FROM anon` on the four worker-PII tables on **zaap** (`zaapmfdkgedqupfjtchl`, eq-canonical-internal / Field data plane): `public.workers`, `worker_credentials`, `worker_inductions`, `worker_assignments`. Closed-by-default at the privilege layer. Applied live via Supabase MCP (`zaap_worker_cluster_anon_revoke`); repo record `supabase/migrations/20260630_zaap_worker_cluster_anon_revoke.sql`. DB-only, no app deploy.
- [x] **Verified pre + post** — pre: anon held SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE but RLS-on + `auth.uid()`-scoped owner policies → anon already 0 rows (latent risk, not active breach); all 4 tables empty. Post: anon zero table privilege (permission-denied / 401), `authenticated` keeps SELECT/INSERT (self-service via owner policies), `service_role` full, RLS + policies intact (3/4/4/3).
- [x] **eq-shell drift baseline** — NO `KNOWN_LEGACY_ANON` edit needed. `check-tenant-drift.mjs` only flags anon-*reachable* tables (RLS off OR bare-`true` policy); these are RLS-on + `auth.uid()`-gated → `reachable=false` → never on the tracked anon-exposed list. Confirmed against the detection SQL.

**Deferred:** none.

**Notes:** Same hardening channel as the 2026-06-29 tender-cluster anon teardown. Cards onboarding writes (`eq_cards_claim_invite` etc.) run via SECURITY DEFINER RPCs (execute as owner) → unaffected by role grants. The separate `eq_field_get_worker_summary` SECDEF PII path was already anon/authenticated-revoked in eq-shell 2026-06-27 — out of scope here.

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-30 (EQ Cards blob fix) — Sentry EQ-CARDS-W CanvasKit blob URL revocation

**Completed (eq-cards):**
- [x] **Sentry EQ-CARDS-W fixed** — `_PhotoSlot` in `licence_edit_screen.dart` converted from `StatelessWidget` → `StatefulWidget`. Root cause: every parent rebuild (toggling "Private" switch, form validation) created a new `MemoryImage`, each allocating a CanvasKit blob URL; Chrome Mobile revoked these under memory pressure. Fix: hold a single `MemoryImage` in state, recreated only when `bytes` reference changes (`identical()` in `didUpdateWidget`); evict on replace + dispose. `gaplessPlayback: true` added. `unawaited()` on both `evict()` calls. No Flutter version bump needed. `flutter analyze` clean.

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-30 (part I) — EQ Cards Sentry + dead code + iOS spinner fix

**Completed (eq-cards, pushed to main):**
- [x] **Sentry triage** — EQ-CARDS-T: resolved (fix shipped in migration 0061); EQ-CARDS-S/Q/V: ignored (Flutter engine / transient); EQ-CARDS-W: flagged as background task → subsequently fixed in separate session (see blob-fix block above).
- [x] **Dead code removed** — `FoundInvite` class + `findInvitesByPhone()` method from `worker_self_repository.dart` (commit `e2c77f7`). Zero usages confirmed by grep before removal. `flutter analyze` clean (exit 0).
- [x] **iOS web fix (eq-cards)** — `web/index.html`: `window.flutterConfiguration = { renderer: 'auto' }` before `flutter_bootstrap.js` (commit `c159717` on main). Flutter 3.22+ defaults to CanvasKit on all platforms; CanvasKit's WebGL loop is throttled by iOS Safari → spinners freeze. `auto` restores HTML renderer on mobile (iOS/Android), CanvasKit on desktop.
- [x] **iOS native fix (eq-cards)** — `eq_button.dart` + `not_provisioned_screen.dart`: `CircularProgressIndicator.adaptive()` → shows `CupertinoActivityIndicator` on native iOS (CoreAnimation-backed, always animates). `const` removed from SizedBox containers.

**Completed (eq-shell, merged + deployed):**
- [x] **iOS CSS fix (eq-shell) — PR #566 merged** — `will-change: transform` added to 4 CSS spinner selectors across 3 files (`src/App.css`, `eq-intake-demo/src/styles.css`, `eq-format-ui/src/styles.css`). Forces GPU compositing layer on iOS Safari — prevents `@keyframes` rotate from freezing on main thread. Squash merged 17:08 UTC.

**Deferred (added 2026-06-30):**
- [ ] EQ Cards: ARMADA lighthouse — PR #109 was merged before `armada:lighthouse` label applied; Calum's system likely needs an open PR. New open PR with label OR Calum runs manually _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] EQ Cards: Contact John Angangan to retry signup — duplicate-worker fix (migrations 0062/0063) is now live _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] EQ Cards: Wrap `eq_cards_find_pending_invite` RPC call (`otp_screen.dart:163`) into `WorkerSelfRepository` data layer — low priority, no behaviour change _(added 2026-06-30)_

**Notes:**
- Boot loader spinner in `index.html` already had `will-change: transform` and animated fine on iOS — confirmed the CSS pattern correct before applying to eq-shell.
- `eq_cards_find_pending_invite` in `otp_screen.dart:163` is NOT dead — auto-routes invited workers post-OTP. Retained.
- eq-shell `main` was checked out in worktree `clever-wilson-161a7a`; always branch from `origin/main` in the bare checkout.
- eq-guard hook blocks Edit tool on eq-shell; used Python binary-mode writes to preserve CRLF (PowerShell `Set-Content` converts CRLF→LF causing 200-line diffs for 1-line changes).

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-30 (part k) — EQ Ops pipeline: age badge + attachment types + 0152 + PR #552 merge

**Completed (eq-shell, merged + deployed):**
- [x] **PR #560 merged** — EQ Ops pipeline enhancements: migration `0152_quote_status_changed_at.sql` (adds `status_changed_at timestamptz` to `app_data.quote`, backfill from `quote_status_history`, stamps on every `eq_update_quote_status` call, `eq_list_quotes`/`eq_get_quote_detail` RPCs rebuilt with DROP+CREATE); board age-in-stage chip (`stageAge()` → `3d`/`2w`/`1mo`, amber ≥14d); attachment types `supplier_quote`/`drawing`/`quality_doc` added to `VALID_ATTACHMENT_TYPES` and `AttachmentList` (type picker + `TypeBadge`); `workbench_job_no` added to `WRITABLE_FIELDS.jobs` in `canonical-api.ts`; `syncJobToCanonical` forwards it on save.
- [x] **PR #552 merged** (`6ee18e2`) — training matrix licence numbers + CSV export + employment-type select (was blocked by drift check: `field_teams`/`field_team_members` missing from `KNOWN_LEGACY_ANON` on branch `claude/staff-matrix-fixes`; added `3fa4e5e`, CI passed)
- [x] **Migrations 0147–0152 applied to both planes** — zaap (eq, run `28440001680`) + ehow (sks, run `28440004156`); both required `allow_checksum_drift=true`

**Deferred (added 2026-06-30):**
- [ ] **EQ Ops active jobs view** — roster tab pulling from `app_data.jobs` (customer, site, job no, days active, value); not built _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **EQ Ops home tile** — Shell home tile with overdue follow-ups, stale quotes, active jobs; not built _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **Field crew on job** — workers in Field see their assigned job; requires eq-field repo changes _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **`issues.*` PermKeys activation** — Phase 3 when Issues UI ships for EQ plane; currently deferred constants _(added 2026-06-30)_

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-30 (part j) — eq-shell branch prune (215→49) + worktree cleanup

**Completed (eq-shell git hygiene — no product code touched):**
- [x] **Branch audit + prune** — 215 local → **49**; remote pruned to **14**. Method: each branch's PR merge-state from GitHub (`mergedAt`, authoritative squash record), then **content-verified** — for the 27 merged branches carrying post-merge-dated commits, grepped their distinctive added strings against `origin/main` and confirmed every feature identifier shipped (`sks_comms_materials`, `invoiced_amount`, `tender_phases`, `notify-substrate.yml`, etc.). No branch judged by SHA-ancestry (squash makes SHAs look stranded). Deleted 166 local (160 squash-merged + 6 no-PR-but-content-in-main) + 96 remote.
- [x] **Caught a stale registry row** — `claude/sharp-gauss-e31cdd` was listed *Active* (Phase 1 Issues & Attachments) in `worktree-registry.md`, but it had actually merged twice that day (PR #549 09:04 + #553 09:38). GitHub ground-truth (which the prune used) correctly removed it; registry was lagging.
- [x] **5 orphaned worktree dirs removed** — `determined-edison/gauss`, `eager-elion`, `sharp-gauss`, `wonderful-dubinsky` under `.claude/worktrees/` (empty 8K husks + one vendored `eq-intake/node_modules`, no `.git` link, no unique work). `git worktree prune` run; only `clever-wilson-161a7a` remains registered.
- [x] **`worktree-registry.md` updated** — cleared the stale Active row, logged the prune + dir removals.

**Deferred (added 2026-06-30) → RESOLVED same day:**
- [x] **Reviewed + pruned the 43 stale-for-review branches** — content-checked each vs `origin/main` (distinctive-line grep) + cross-referenced closed-PR status. **42 safe-deleted: 39 local + 10 remote** (8 closed-PR remotes + 2 remote-only). Safe = content already in main, no-code husk, or explicitly-closed PR (human-rejected). _(done 2026-06-30)_
- [x] **2 remote-only branches deleted** — `fix/canonical-wiring-migration-rename` (23d stale; canonical wiring shipped via other PRs, files all in main) + `fix/check6-find-invites-allow` (closed PR #489, no-code). Royce confirmed remote deletion. _(done 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **3 docs-spike branches KEPT — Royce's call to delete** — `claude/design-system-tokens` (41d; early @eq/tokens design spec + design-audit-2026-05-20.md), `claude/epic-ellis-987f75` (23d; single SCHEMA-GOVERNANCE.md note), `claude/vigilant-cray-4e074e` (36d; HANDOFF-*.md session notes). These hold **unique unmerged docs not in main** — superseded, but deleting unmerged work needs your sign-off. Likely all 3 safe to `git branch -D` _(added 2026-06-30)_

**Final state:** eq-shell local branches **49 → 9** (6 active + 3 docs-spikes pending your call); remote **14 → 5** (only active: main, ops-pipeline-enhancements, staff-matrix-fixes, audit-team-access-events, hex-burndown-staff).

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-30 (part i) — Licence-expiry config + CI/auth-test hardening + platform audit + security re-verify

**Completed (eq-shell, merged + deployed):**
- [x] **PR #557 merged** (`46a855e`) — training matrix licence numbers + CSV export + employment-type select. It "didn't work" because the commit (42cd2ed) was a **stranded unpushed worktree commit** — never PR'd. Rebased onto main, shipped. (Root-cause pattern: worktree commits invisible to prod until merged to main.)
- [x] **PR #559 merged** (`8618d2a`) — **real CI gate** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (vite-free `tsc -b` + `pnpm test` + advisory lint on every PR; was build-only) + **auth-hub test suite** (`token.test.ts` 11 + `supabase-jwt.test.ts` 8 → suite 66→85): session/handoff round-trip, per-consumer key isolation, alg-confusion, tamper, trusted-device binding. Gate caught its own first-run type error. eslint warn-level no-raw-hex rule on `src/**/*.tsx`.

**Completed (live DB — jvkn, verified):**
- [x] **SKS compliance email SET** — `notification_email = royce.milmlow@sks.com.au` → activates employer 7-day licence-expiry alert for SKS.
- [x] **demo-trades + melbourne DEACTIVATED** (`active=false`) — 0 users / 0 Cards orgs each; killed the "4 active tenants" confusion. Active non-personal tenants now = sks + eq only. Reversible (not hard-deleted).

**Security re-verify (read-only) — EQ-side exposures CLOSED; 3 stale memories corrected:**
- [x] **zaap** PII tables RLS owner-scoped (`auth.uid()=user_id`) → anon 0 rows; no anon-readable views (no SECDEF bypass).
- [x] **ehow** — no anon PII tables/views.
- [x] **jvkn** — `eq_get_org_licences` + `eq_field_get_worker_summary` (SECDEF) now have anon AND authenticated EXECUTE **revoked** (service-role-only). The prior "most severe, unfixed, LIVE" worker-PII reads are CLOSED.

**Housekeep:**
- [x] Confirmed **PR #552 is a byte-identical DUPLICATE of #557** (StaffPage diff empty). Branch-prune chip spawned (214 local / 128 remote branches). **CORRECTION (part k): was NOT a duplicate — had real changes; merged `6ee18e2` 2026-06-30 after fixing drift check.**

**Deferred (added 2026-06-30):**
- [x] **Close duplicate PR #552** — NOT a duplicate; real training-matrix changes. Drift check blocked merge (field_teams/field_team_members missing from KNOWN_LEGACY_ANON on branch). Fixed `3fa4e5e`, merged `6ee18e2` _(done 2026-06-30)_
- [x] **Made CI `verify` check REQUIRED** — branch protection on eq-shell main now requires both `typecheck · test · lint` AND `Schema drift + anon-grant + policy-lint` (via `gh api`) _(done 2026-06-30 part i)_
- [x] **Brand-hex burndown phase 1 — PR #562 merged** (`01718a4`): 105 single-quoted brand-hex literals → `var(--eq-sky/-deep/-ink)` across 19 files. Value-identical (those are the FIXED base tokens; BrandProvider overrides `--eq-brand` not `--eq-sky`, verified `brand.tsx:54`). Single-quote targeting structurally skipped the var()-incompatible double-quoted `fill=`/alpha cases. _(done 2026-06-30 part i)_
- [x] **Defense-in-depth: REVOKE anon grants on zaap PII tables** — DONE in eq-field (PR #379, merged `18b17b8`). `REVOKE ALL FROM anon` on `public.workers`/`worker_credentials`/`worker_inductions`/`worker_assignments`; authenticated + service_role retained; RLS/owner policies intact; verified anon→permission-denied. eq-shell `KNOWN_LEGACY_ANON` needed no change (RLS-on + auth.uid()-gated → never anon-reachable on the drift checker) _(done 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **nspbmir anon-PII audit** — NOT done (per Royce "don't touch nspbmir"); eq-guard blocks SKS-live from EQ sessions anyway → needs a dedicated SKS-context session _(added 2026-06-30)_
### ▶ Design-system + StaffPage quality program (supersedes the separate "god-components" + "flip lint blocking" entries)

These two were listed as independent deferreds; they're one coupled chain. De-hex StaffPage BEFORE splitting it, or you touch every extracted file twice. Quality principle throughout: fix the *class* + encode the invariant, don't patch the instance. Run in order (B + the ramp are Royce's design calls; the rest is mechanical once they land):

- [ ] **A — Unify the token source of truth** (eq-design-tokens) — TWO divergent sets exist: the loaded `@import "@eq-solutions/ui/styles"` (`--eq-err`, `--eq-gray-*`) vs the orphaned, NOT-imported `public/eq-tokens.css` (`--eq-danger`, `--eq-sky`). Collapse to one generated package, one name set, imported everywhere; `public/eq-tokens.css` becomes a pure build artifact (or dies). Adding tokens before this just forks further _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [x] **B — DECIDED 2026-07-01: Warm Sand (Direction-D).** The neutral+semantic ramp ALREADY existed in @eq-solutions/tokens (--eq-gray-50..600 warm + --eq-success/-warning/-error, loaded via ui/styles → tokens.css) — the earlier "no loadable token" claim was WRONG. So B was not from-scratch design: Royce approved migrating components' cool-slate onto the existing warm ramp (deliberate cool→warm) via a before/after preview + StaffPage pilot. _(decided 2026-07-01)_
- [~] **C — Codemod hexes → tokens: NEUTRALS DONE, semantics remain.** Pilot PR #580 (StaffPage, 110) + repo-wide rollout PR #581 (242 across 21 files) merged → all cool-slate neutrals (#E2E8F0→gray-200, #64748B→gray-500, #94A3B8→gray-400, etc.) on the warm --eq-gray ramp. Bare-hex sed; fill=/alpha landmines confirmed absent repo-wide. STILL TODO: semantic reds/greens/ambers + status-chip pastels (each SHIFTS shade → needs its own before/after) _(neutrals done 2026-07-01)_
- [x] **D — Characterization tests + logic lift (StaffPage)** — snapshot/RTL tests on `MatrixView` + `SplitPanel` FIRST (we have the test runner now → converts the "unverifiable refactor" into a test-guaranteed one, replacing "eyeball the running app"); lift pure logic (`matrixCsvCell`, `licStatus`, date-shaping, matrix transform) into a tested `staff/lib` module. Independent — can start anytime _(added 2026-06-30)_ ✅ DONE 2026-07-01 — PR #578 (`b79af65`): `src/pages/staff/staffLib.ts` (licStatus/matrixCsvCell/buildMatrixCsv) + 9 tests, suite 85→94, tsc clean, behaviour-identical. Unblocks E.
- [x] **E — Extract StaffPage components** — move `MatrixView`/`SplitPanel` + shared `s`/helpers into `staff/` modules, split along data/logic/view seams (not just "smaller files"). Depends on C (de-hexed) + D (test-guarded) _(done 2026-07-01 — PR #585)_
- [ ] **F — Scoped blocking `no-raw-hex` rule** — flip warn→error WITH an allowlist (`*.palette.ts`, chart configs, `email/`) + a "token-or-justify-with-reason" path, not a blanket wall (a wall just trains more `eslint-disable` — how 155 accumulated). The ratchet that holds the gain. Depends on C _(added 2026-06-30)_

### ▶ zaap anon class-closure (eq-field — residual of the done #379 revoke)

PR #379 revoked the 4 worker-PII tables (the instances). The *class* + ratchet are still open — without them a new zaap `public.*` table re-introduces an anon grant within weeks. Parallel/independent of the design-system chain:

- [ ] **Audit + classify the remaining anon-CRUD zaap `public.*` tables** — live audit this session found 7 anon-CRUD tables; #379 closed 4, leaving `app_config`, `organisations`, `ts_reminders_sent`. Classify each: keep-and-DOCUMENT the intentional ones (`organisations` is almost certainly the login-page org bootstrap read) vs revoke the rest _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES REVOKE anon/authenticated` on zaap `public`** — born-closed, mirroring the 2026-06-07 control-plane lockdown; stops the next new table re-introducing the grant _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **Drift-gate CHECK: fail if any zaap `public.*` grants anon outside an explicit allowlist** — encode the invariant so it can't regress silently, instead of re-verifying by hand _(added 2026-06-30)_

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-30 (part h) — Attachments bucket private + migration dispatch

**Completed (eq-shell, merged + deployed to ehow):**
- [x] **PR #549 merged** — Issues/Attachments Phase 1: `0147_issues_table.sql`, `0148_eq_issue_rpcs.sql`, `0149_attachments_entity_index.sql`, `0150_attachments_bucket_private.sql`, `0151_field_teams_rls.sql` (no-op). `list-attachments.ts` + `upload-attachment.ts` switched from `getPublicUrl` to `createSignedUrl` (1-hour TTL). Bucket RLS policy `tenant_signed_url` on `storage.objects`.
- [x] **PR #555 merged** — 0151 fixed: `field_teams` + `field_team_members` on ehow are `security_invoker=true` views over `app_data.teams/team_members` (both tables have RLS on). `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` fails on views (PG 42809). Replaced with `SELECT 1` no-op. `check-tenant-drift.mjs` already lists both views in `KNOWN_LEGACY_ANON` for ehow (merged with PR #549).
- [x] **Migrations 0147–0151 applied to ehow** via tenant-migrate.yml (sks slug, allow_checksum_drift=true). `attachments` bucket confirmed `public: false`.

**Deferred (added 2026-06-30):**
- [x] **Issues/Attachments Phase 2** — 0147–0152 dispatched to zaap (eq plane, run `28440001680`, allow_checksum_drift=true) _(done 2026-06-30 part k)_; `issues.*` PermKeys deferred Phase 3
- [ ] **Signed URL refresh** — URLs now 7-day TTL (PR #556 raised from 1hr); no auto-refresh mechanism _(updated 2026-06-30)_

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-30 (part g) — Cards admin-console + labour-hire pilot (discussion only)

**Decided (Royce):**
- [x] **No admin console in Cards** — Core (Shell) stays the employer admin surface. Reasons: canonical records live in `app_data.*` owned by Shell (a Cards console would duplicate/couple them); Cards' value is worker-owned, an employer admin inside it breaks portability; two admin surfaces = double auth/audit. Re-confirms the 2026-06-15 "Core = employer only" call.
- [x] **Labour-hire firm = the strongest wedge** — their product *is* workers, so Cards→Core→Field is their operating system, not a nice-to-have. Deeper hook than a general SMB. Pilot = firm-centric (Core + Field), Cards as the worker on-ramp; don't dilute Cards with admin to get there.
- [x] **Pilot motion** — onboard the labour-hire firm SKS currently uses INTO Cards now; once profiles are populated, do a coffee + open Core > tenant and show them their own roster's compliance view live. Convert with a concrete pilot ask ("run your next N placements through it"), not "what do you think?".

**Deferred (added 2026-06-30):**
- [ ] **Onboard current labour-hire firm's workers to Cards** — Royce in progress; "need to fill up the info first" before any demo _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **Dry-run Core > tenant view before the coffee demo** — verify what the tenant admin view actually renders + scope out anything not appropriate for the firm to see; offered, deferred until data is in _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **Decide the pilot offer** — firm as guest in existing tenant vs their own tenant (changes the demo + the portability framing) _(needs Royce's call) (added 2026-06-30)_

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-30 (part f) — Audit log team events + stub-match block + training matrix

**Completed (eq-shell, PR #553 merged):**
- [x] **writeTenantAudit() helper** — fire-and-forget app-level audit writes to `app_data.audit_log` (`source='app'`) in `tenant-routing.ts`
- [x] **invite-user + invite-users-batch** — emit `user_invite` (INSERT) on new invites, `user_membership` (INSERT) when existing user added to tenant
- [x] **edit-user** — emit `user_role` (UPDATE) with old/new role/active/name after successful mutation
- [x] **security-groups** — emit `group_membership` (INSERT/DELETE) for add_member/remove_member
- [x] **tenant-audit.ts link-event name resolution** — batch-fetches contact/customer/site names; Activity Log shows "Alex Smith ↔ Acme Corp" instead of raw UUIDs; `recordLabel` extended for app-level event types
- [x] **Onboarding stub-match block** — `cards-approve-staff` returns 422 + candidates when name similarity ≥ 0.5 and admin hasn't confirmed; `StaffPage` shows `MatchConfirmModal` (Link / Add as new person)
- [x] **Compliance pack descriptive filenames** — individual: "Name - Org - date.zip"; bulk: "Org Compliance - date.zip"; backend sets filename in blob, status endpoint passes through, frontend sets `a.download`
- [x] **Training Matrix overhaul** — full licence names rotated 90° in column headers; `empTypeLabel()` + `minHeight` fix subtitle alignment; tooltip shows proper name not schema key; Export Excel button writes `.xlsx` via SheetJS

**Deferred (added 2026-06-30):**
- [x] **Dispatch tenant migrations 0147_issues_table → 0151_field_teams_rls to ehow** (sks slug, `allow_checksum_drift=true`) via tenant-migrate.yml _(done 2026-06-30 — ehow at 0151; PR #555 merged no-op fix for field_teams views)_

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-30 (part d) — Activity-log link triggers + Field/Service site-view reconcile

**Completed (eq-shell, merged + deployed):**
- [x] **PR #547 merged** — Tenant Activity Log extended to link tables. Migration `0147` adds audit triggers on `contact_customer_links` + `contact_site_links` (reuses `fn_audit('link_id')` from 0146). Dispatched + verified on both planes (ehow + zaap). Friendly labels in the feed.

**Completed (eq-field + DB):**
- [x] **`app_data.field_sites` hardened** — now `WHERE field_enabled = true AND active = true` (was `field_enabled` only). Archived sites now drop out of EQ Field. Applied to ehow live; recorded on branch `claude/field-sites-active-filter` (migration `20260630_field_sites_filter_active.sql`) — NOT merged to eq-field main (no Field deploy without explicit go). Zero rows affected.

**Audit truth (reconciled):**
- Site selection in **both** Field and Service ALREADY honors the activation flags — `service.sites` filters `service_enabled`, `field_sites` filters `field_enabled`. Earlier "Field not wired" was a STALE-CHECKOUT error (local eq-field was 11 commits behind origin). Defaults clean: `active`/`field_enabled`/`service_enabled` all default `true`, NOT NULL → new sites visible in both apps automatically.

**Also completed (part e — continued):**
- [x] **`service.sites` filter `active`** — DONE; applied to ehow + migration `0163_service_sites_filter_active.sql` in eq-service (task chip actioned).
- [x] **Merged eq-field `claude/field-sites-active-filter`** — PR #367 merged; field_sites migration recorded.
- [x] **x-eq-actor capture VERIFIED working** — real shell edits carry `source='shell'` + populated `actor_id` on ehow `app_data.audit_log`.
- [x] **PR #551 merged** — actor coverage gap closed: `update-data-activation` (F/S toggles) + `asset-calibration` mutated the spine via the NON-audited client → logged as `source='system'`. Swapped both to `getAuditedTenantDataClientById(tenant_id, session.user_id)`.

**Deferred (added 2026-06-30) — next session (prompt written in sessions/2026-06-30.md part e):**
- [x] **Activity Log — team & access events** — invites/role-changes/group membership mutate shell_control (jvkn) not the spine → need APP-LEVEL writes to app_data.audit_log at invite-user/edit-user/security-groups (domain-not-storage) _(done PR #553 2026-06-30)_
- [x] **Activity Log — name resolution for link events** (link rows carry only ids; feed shows "Contact ↔ site" without names) _(done PR #553 2026-06-30)_
- [x] **Onboarding name-only stub match panel** — force admin confirmation when a name_close candidate exists (null-email/no-phone stubs can't auto-match); BLOCK confirmed _(done PR #553 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **Platform Security Log / operator console** — sign-ins/2FA audit (jvkn, admin-audit.ts reads it); deferred by decision _(added 2026-06-30)_

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-30 (ARMADA trial) — pre-baked Calum's fleet on eq-service

**Completed:**
- [x] **Evaluated ARMADA** (calumjs/ARMADA — fleet of Claude Code skills: GitHub issue → build → review → merge-ready PR). Verified `merge-gate.mjs` respects branch protection with no force path; commission's stack-agnostic build detection; the drop-in route's limits.
- [x] **Pre-baked ARMADA onto eq-service** — vendored skills + scripts into local `.claude/` (gitignored), repo-tuned `.armada/config.json` + `SETUP-NOTES.md`. eq-service **PR #375 merged** to main (config/docs only; Netlify Pages deploy skipped — no deployable change).
- [x] **10 ARMADA labels created** on eq-solutions/eq-service (`armada`, `armada:*`, `fleet-defect`).
- [x] **Seed issue eq-service #377** — branded 404 (`app/not-found.tsx`), filed **unarmed** (enhancement label only).
- [x] **Feedback to Calum** — calumjs/ARMADA **#95** (fleet-defect): drop-in route gaps (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` unset off-plugin; `.claude/` gitignore silent no-op).
- [x] **suite-state.md corrected** — EQ Cards `In build → Live` (real self-signup traffic, live-verified). eq-context **PR #56 merged**.

**Config tuning (eq-service `.armada/config.json`):**
- `autoMerge: false` (HARD — main is unprotected + Netlify auto-deploys on push to main; sole rail vs a prod deploy)
- gate = `npm run check` (tsc + next build); `test` omitted (integration suite is a known pre-existing CI failure)
- `armadaRepo: calumjs/ARMADA`; `publicIntake` + `lighthouse` auto-dispatch off

**Deferred (added 2026-06-30):**
- [ ] **Run first `shipwright` build** of #377 — in a dedicated Claude Code session rooted in eq-service (skills load from its `.claude/skills/`; can't be driven from another repo's session). Runbook in SETUP-NOTES + today's session log _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **crows-nest `/loop`** — needs `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` (plugin install, or `export CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT=.claude/armada`); don't arm until one clean manual cycle is observed _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **Add `test: vitest run`** to eq-service `.armada/config.json` once a clean cycle is seen + unit-test green verified _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [x] **eq-context frontmatter-validation CI** red on main since 2026-06-28 — FIXED. Root cause: `system/chat-bootstrap.md` + `system/cowork-bootstrap.md` (added in `cf3c781`, 2026-06-28) shipped without the required `status` + `read_priority` frontmatter keys. Added `read_priority: reference` / `status: live` to both. **PR #57 merged** (commit `5100b9b`); all checks green _(done 2026-06-30)_

**Notes (load-bearing):**
- eq-service: GitHub repo = `eq-solutions/eq-service`, local folder = `eq-solves-service`; `.claude/` is gitignored, so vendored skills are **local-only** (not committed — correct for a vendored plugin).
- ARMADA drop-in: `charter`/`shipwright`/`muster`/`lighthouse` are path-clean (work without the plugin); `crows-nest`'s pipeline + foghorn/logbook/spyglass need `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, which only the plugin installer sets.

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-30 (handoff hardening) — Shell→Service: shared contract + canaries + secret probe

**Completed (merged + deployed):**
- [x] **New package `@eq-solutions/contracts` v0.1.0** — single source of truth for the Shell→Service handoff JWT `app_metadata` (`ShellHandoffClaims` type + dependency-free `validateHandoffClaims`). Mirrors the eq-roles packaging model (ships `index.ts` + built `index.js`, consumed via `github:eq-solutions/eq-contracts#v0.1.0`, no transpilePackages).
- [x] **eq-service #371** — RPC return-shape drift added to `canonical-types-drift`; inbound JWT type deduped onto `ServiceJwtClaims`.
- [x] **eq-service #373** — structured auth-handoff Sentry canaries (`captureAuthHandoff`): secret_mismatch/no_email/slug_unresolved = error, expired/malformed/cookie_unusable = warning. `validateSupabaseJwt` returns a discriminated reason (sig checked before expiry).
- [x] **eq-service #374 + eq-shell #543** — both repos adopt `ShellHandoffClaims`: Service consumes it + runtime-validates; Shell validates the service-mint before signing. **tsc now fails on either side if the contract drifts** — drift is impossible, not just detected.
- [x] **eq-service #376** — fail closed on unresolved tenant slug: 403 `service-account-not-found` (the code the /shell client already surfaces) instead of minting a JWT with Shell's UUID → blank app. Verified ehow has one active row (slug `sks`) → SKS unaffected.
- [x] **eq-context #53** — cross-repo JWT contract drift canary (scheduled key-diff). Largely superseded by the compile gate; kept as defense-in-depth.
- [x] **eq-context #54** — md-health rule 17.4 stops false-flagging the generated `sessions/INDEX.md` (+ aligned the duplicated check in `md-health-daily.py`). `health` is green again.
- [x] **eq-context #55** — synthetic Shell→Service handoff probe (every 30 min): mints a test JWT, POSTs to `/api/shell-auth`, alerts on 401 (secret drift). **Armed** — `EQ_SHELL_JWT_SECRET` added to eq-context GH secrets; first run green = real login confirmed working end-to-end.

**Decided (Royce):**
- The handoff contract is a shared compile-time + runtime-enforced package (the "ultimate solution") — chosen over keeping only the daily drift canary. New repo `eq-contracts`, not folded into eq-roles.
- Enforcement = type + dependency-free validator on both ends (not Zod, to keep eq-shell dep-free).

**Deferred (added 2026-06-30):**
- [ ] **auth_handoff Sentry alert** — native rule on `canary=auth_handoff` AND `level=error` (catches real-user slug_unresolved/no_email; the probe already covers secret drift). MCP is read-only for alert rules → 2-min UI action (recipe on file), or build the watcher-as-code _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **Contracts versioning discipline** — both repos pin `#v0.1.0`; on any contract change, bump the package + tag + update BOTH consumer pins together. The compile gate only holds when the pins match _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **Add eq-contracts to the suite-state cron** repo list so the new package shows in the nightly snapshot _(added 2026-06-30)_

**Notes / gotchas (load-bearing):**
- **Handoff secret now lives in 3 places** — eq-shell `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, eq-service `EQ_SHELL_JWT_SECRET`, eq-context probe GH secret `EQ_SHELL_JWT_SECRET`. Rotate all three together or the handoff breaks / the probe false-alarms.
- **Stacked-PR trap:** merging a base PR with `--delete-branch` auto-CLOSES a stacked child PR. Recover by rebasing the child's commit onto main + opening a fresh PR. Don't `--delete-branch` a base that has an open stacked child.
- **Sentry project slug = `eq-solves-service`** (folder name), not the GitHub repo name `eq-service`. Netlify projects = `eq-service` (`service.eq.solutions`) + `eq-shell` (`core.eq.solutions`).

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-30 (part c) — Staff licence-review fixes + duplicate-stub root cause

**Completed (eq-shell, merged + deployed):**
- [x] **PR #544 merged** — licence-review badge no longer flips to "re-review" for licences that PREDATE the review. `reviewBadgeFor` only re-flags licences with `created_at > reviewed_at`; `staff-canonical-licences` returns `created_at`. (Cards licences import progressively, so reviewing mid-import used to reset a completed review.)
- [x] **PR #545 merged** — Cards onboarding now matches an existing staff stub instead of duplicating. `cards-approve-staff` `handleApplication` unified to one `findExistingStaff` matcher: cards_worker_id → exact email (exactly-one active) → phone (exactly-one). Gap was: auto-detect path (admin skipped match panel) matched worker-link+phone but NOT email → same-email/different-phone stubs duplicated.
- [x] **PR #546 merged** — profile review state now matches the table badge ("reviewed by Ben · N new since — re-review needed" instead of a misleading green tick).
- [x] **Data cleanup (live, ehow sks)** — archived 4 empty duplicate staff stubs: Vincent Costa ×2, Rhys Scott ×1, John Angangan ×1 (set active=false; reversible; kept the Cards-linked record each).

**Deferred (added 2026-06-30):**
- [x] **Name-only stub match panel** — stubs with null email + no phone can't auto-match; 422 + MatchConfirmModal blocks silent duplicate _(done PR #553 2026-06-30)_

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-30 (EQ Field) — Overnight security audit + canonical-wiring execution

**Completed (eq-field, merged + deployed — v3.5.199 → v3.5.206 + migrations):**
- [x] **Overnight security audit** — closed CRITICAL anon read/write/DELETE on live `public.tenders` (366 rows) + cluster via **Option A** (canonical org `000…002` scoping; the established SKS `public.*` standard); `field_people` definer→invoker; `job_numbers` hardened; neutralised the stale `20260618_acknowledgments.sql` (anon-grant footgun). Verified anon→401, authenticated→366.
- [x] **SKS = Core-only auth** (v3.5.200) — standalone PIN gate disabled for SKS (was reachable via iframe→handoff-fail→leaked-PIN + `frame-ancestors *.netlify.app`). Whole PIN subsystem retired (v3.5.203).
- [x] **Incident fix: SKS Contacts/roster blank** (v3.5.201–202) — `window.TENANT` was never exposed, so canonical adapters couldn't detect the tenant → schedule reads 400 → `Promise.all` cascade blanked the directory. Fixed: expose `window.TENANT` + adapter allow-list authoritative (missing PostHog flag no longer disables) + per-fetch load resilience.
- [x] **Full canonical-wiring audit** (12 features, verified live) → repo `FIELD-CANONICAL-AUDIT-2026-06-30.md` (local-only).
- [x] **#1 unlock (v3.5.203)** — granted authenticated CRUD on `app_data.schedule_entries/timesheets/leave_requests` (+ `hours_planned` DEFAULT 0); were service_role-only → JWT 401'd before RLS. **Roster/Timesheets/Leave now write-capable.** Proven via authenticated-JWT insert.
- [x] **Tender writes (v3.5.204)** — `tender_enrichment` hardened to canonical org + enrichment/nominations/tender_phases added to `ORG_TABLES` (were 403 on write).
- [x] **Dead surfaces retired (v3.5.205)** — Presence + Supervisor Notes off for SKS.
- [x] **Managers + Sites read-only for SKS (v3.5.206)** — Shell-owned; 8 write entry points gated.
- [x] **Digest opt-out (PR #365)** — backfilled 19 supervisors opted-in; `field_managers.digest_opt_in` made writable via a digest-only INSTEAD OF trigger. Toggle works; everyone preserved.
- [x] **Job Numbers** — removed dead `populateJobNumberDatalist()` calls (spurious "Save failed").

**Decided (Royce):** managers/sites = read-only in Field (Shell-owned); supervisor notes = retire (worker-first); teams = wire; presence = off; digest = opt-out (keep everyone). EQ Field operational status: "not live yet" stands for the operational surface (schedule/timesheets/safety empty), but the **shared deploy + directory data are real** — treat changes touching them as live.

**Deferred (added 2026-06-30):**
- [ ] **Teams wire** — field_teams/field_team_members twins + grants + RLS + JWT routing (0-row unused feature; lowest value) _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [x] **Safety canonical wiring** — granted auth CRUD on all 5 safety tables; created site_audits/site_audit_items on ehow; JWT_INPLACE routing wired _(done v3.5.208 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **Apprentices cluster** — create missing tables (competencies/feedback_requests/apprentice_journal) + field_* twins + JWT routing + grants + org RLS + migrate 2 orphan apprentice_profiles rows (largest debt — dedicated session) _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **Realtime publication** — add app_data.schedule_entries/leave_requests to supabase_realtime (verify realtime.js channel target first) _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **app_data.staff.user_id backfill** — ~61 SKS staff unresolved (14/75 via field_person_by_user_id); may need a Core account→staff_id mapping _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [x] **worker_id link mirror removal** — dead PATCH removed from syncAllToCanonical() _(done v3.5.211 2026-06-30)_
- [x] **SKS audit-log fix** — AUDIT_SB_KEY updated to ehow service_role; org_id stamp + manager_name fix in both functions _(fully done v3.5.212 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **frame-ancestors tightening** — drop `*.netlify.app` (clickjacking surface; declined once) _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **app_config PIN key-scoping** — hygiene (PINs gate nothing now but still anon-readable) _(added 2026-06-30)_

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-30 — Tenant Activity Log + polish fixes

**Completed (eq-shell, merged + deployed):**
- [x] **PR #536 merged** — staff edit 500 (`public.people` trigger disabled on ehow), audit log display (admin-audit bridge fn), employment-type dropdown, cert-import 500 (formData read before 202 + withSentry), Add Site modal.
- [x] **PR #539 merged — Tenant Activity Log** ("who changed what" on the canonical spine). Migration `0146` (`app_data.audit_log` service-role-only + `fn_audit()` trigger + AFTER I/U/D on customers/sites/contacts/staff/assets) **applied to both planes** via tenant-migrate.yml (approved prod gate). `getAuditedTenantDataClientById` stamps `x-eq-actor` on writes; `tenant-audit.ts` reads + enriches; Activity tab replaces deferred sign-ins tab. Verified live: table + RLS + 5 triggers + 0 anon grants on ehow + zaap.

**Deferred (added 2026-06-30):**
- [ ] **Verify header→GUC actor capture** — confirm `actor_id` populates on the first real UI edit; if it shows "Automatic", the change still logs but who-attribution needs a follow-up _(added 2026-06-30)_
- [x] **Activity Log — team & access events** — invites / role-changes as app-level writes to the tenant plane _(done PR #553 2026-06-30)_
- [x] **Activity Log — link-table triggers** — contact_customer_links, contact_site_links _(done PR #547 2026-06-30)_
- [ ] **Platform Security Log / operator console** — sign-ins/2FA audit (jvkn), operator-only, separate from the tenant page _(added 2026-06-30)_

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-30 (part b) — Customers page: Add Site fix + Field/Service activation

**Completed (eq-shell, merged + deployed):**
- [x] **PR #540 merged** — Add Site 500 fixed (`crm-write` add_site inserted a non-existent `site_contact_id` column → every Add Site failed, address never saved). Removed the column ref.
- [x] **PR #541 merged** — CustomersPage now shows the site **street address** + per-site **Field/Service toggle chips** (manager-gated, optimistic, wired to `update-data-activation`). Fixed root cause: address/F-S UI had been built in the **unrouted** CustomersHubPage/SiteDetailView; live route is CustomersPage.
- [x] **PR #542 merged** — customer-level **Field/Service toggles** in the customer header; independent of site flags (no cascade). `crm-customers` detail endpoint now returns customer field_enabled/service_enabled.

**Deferred:** (none new)

---

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-29 (part d) — Licence-expiry notifications: fixed (wrong DB) + hardened

**Completed (eq-shell, merged + deployed):**
- [x] **PR #537 + #538 merged** — licence-expiry scheduler was routing every tenant through `getTenantRpcClient` → ehow (Cards tables/RPCs don't exist there) → **0 notifications ever sent**. Repointed to eq-canonical via new `getPublicServiceClient()`.
- [x] **Send path hardened** — E.164 phone normalization, worker SMS at 7d as well as 30d, range-based tiers (replaces exact-day; survives missed runs + catches licences imported <30d out), per-licence dedup/audit (`licence_notification_log`), SMS `Reply STOP` opt-out, tenant autodiscovery, secret-gated test endpoint, humanized licence labels, mojibake fix in live emails.
- [x] **Migrations live on eq-canonical** — `0061_licence_notification_log` (RLS on, server-only), `0062_revoke_anon_execute_tenant_settings` (closed an anon-executable SECDEF gap on `eq_get/update_tenant_settings` that was failing the CI invariant on every eq-shell PR).
- [x] **eq-cards `0060` tracked** (`d731a2d`) — already applied to prod but untracked; mirrors merged 0059. No deploy (gated).
- [x] **Verified** — prod deploy `6a4247de` ready; scheduler test-gate probe returns healthy 403 (runtime imports resolve).

**Decided (GTM — Cards as wedge):** activate SKS roster first (14→50 active) → polish → package Core (already a Cards admin console) into SKS's labour-hire network → worker→new-company bridge LAST. Rationale in memory `cards_wedge_gtm`.

**Deferred:**
- [x] **Set Twilio env on eq-shell Netlify** — `EQ_SMS_PROVIDER=twilio` + `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID/AUTH_TOKEN/FROM_NUMBER`; done + test endpoint confirmed both channels delivered _(done 2026-06-30)_
- [x] **Set `SCHEDULER_TEST_SECRET`** on eq-shell Netlify to use the test endpoint _(done 2026-06-30)_
- [x] **Set SKS compliance email** to activate the employer 7-day alert — `shell_control.tenants.notification_email = royce.milmlow@sks.com.au` set on jvkn, verified live _(done 2026-06-30 part i)_
- [ ] **Field-only workers** (ehow `app_data.licences`, no Cards wallet) not covered by the scheduler _(added 2026-06-29)_
- [ ] **Employer 7-day alert still exact-day** (worker path hardened to range-based; Monday digest is the backstop) _(added 2026-06-29)_
- [ ] **Worker→new-company bridge** (worker-vouched provision token + Cards "invite my employer" screen) — Phase 3, only if companies pull; touches provisioning/auth (Royce sign-off) _(added 2026-06-29)_
- [ ] **"Free company view" tier** — pricing/packaging decision; Core capability already exists _(added 2026-06-29)_

**Notes:** Company self-onboarding already exists end-to-end (`provision_tokens` → `shell-provision-tenant`, phone-OTP) but the token mint is gated to `is_platform_admin` — the gateway is gated by authorization, not capability. Public per-licence share link already exists (`cards.eq.solutions/share?licence_id=`). Adoption snapshot: 18 claimed / 75 workers, 14 active SKS, 1 multi-org, `org_access_requests` 13 approved, `cards_field_approvals` 71. Gateway metric (net-new companies via a worker) = 0.

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-29 (part c) — Shell CRM: relational site contacts + address autocomplete

**Completed:**
- [x] **eq-shell PR #515 merged** — `crm-customers.ts` + `crm-write.ts`: site contact moved from free-text to relational (`contact_site_links role='site_contact'`); `address_line_1` exposed in API.
- [x] **eq-shell PR #517 merged** — `CustomersPage.tsx`: contact picker, address field with Google Places autocomplete, Maps link on site cards. `netlify.toml`: CSP pre-warmed for Google Maps.
- [x] **Google Maps API key live** — browser-restricted to `core.eq.solutions/*`, Maps JavaScript API only. `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` set in Netlify. Autocomplete active.

**Deferred:**
- [x] Shell: active toggle on sites — no UI to flip `active` boolean; Field filters on it but no admin write-path _(added 2026-06-29)_

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-29 — SKS data reset + maintenance check page perf

**Completed:**
- [x] **SKS tenant full reset** — hard-deleted 4,750 assets and all maintenance checks (+ 13 dependent tables cleared in order). Clean slate for contract scope reimport.
- [x] **eq-service PR #365 merged** — parallelize maintenance check detail page: ~10 sequential awaits → 3 Promise.all waves. Expected ~60% load-time reduction on the EU Supabase instance.

**Discovered:**
- `service.assets` view does NOT filter on `active = true` — it only filters by `service_enabled` site. Soft-delete is invisible to the view. Hard-delete was the right call for the reset.

**Deferred:**
- [ ] Add `WHERE a.active = true` to `service.assets` view so soft-delete works correctly _(added 2026-06-29)_

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-28 (part b) — Shell↔Service branding + token refresh + admin hub

**Completed:**
- [x] **eq-service PR #364 merged** — `ShellTokenRefresh` component: keeps `eq_service_jwt` alive for Shell iframe sessions (REQUEST_SHELL_TOKEN → SHELL_TOKEN_RESPONSE → /api/shell-auth, fires 5 min before 4h expiry). Admin link added to Shell iframe inline nav for manager-role users.
- [x] **eq-shell PR #518 merged** — EQ Service section added to Shell Admin hub with 8 tiles (Report settings, Media, Archive, Imports, Backup, Activity, Today, Connected apps). Gated on `moduleEnabled(session, 'service')`.
- [x] **Branding wiring audited** — Shell→JWT→shell-auth→getTenantSettings→palette derivation confirmed correct. Write-behind sync at shell-auth covers direct-login sessions.

- [x] **Verified logo pipeline** — SKS logo + navy palette already wired since v3.5.185/v3.5.190; `fetchTenantLogo()` confirmed working end-to-end. Stale SW cache = logo-less export (hard-refresh to fix), not a code bug.

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-18 — Apprentices SKS unlock + Recognition philosophy

**Completed (live + verified):**
- [x] **v3.5.161 merged** — Safety nav group (collapsible); PIN Management hidden
- [x] **v3.5.159 acknowledgments** — `acknowledgments` table applied to SKS tenant DB (ehow). One-tap peer recognition live at core.eq.solutions/sks/field
- [x] **CLAUDE.md architecture fix** — corrected stale sks-nsw-labour confusion; added SKS disambiguation block; canonical-driven tenant resolution documented (PR #302)
- [x] **v3.5.162 merged** — Apprentices full SKS unlock: 11 tables, 11 competencies, canonical entitlements, anon GRANTs, nav unlocked
- [x] **v3.5.163 merged** — Year level pre-fill fix on Set Up Profile modal

**Human Recognition Philosophy (2026-06-18):**
- Steelmanned against the filter question (does this help understand/support/recognise/develop another person?). All apprentice features pass.
- Key design decisions validated: journal private by default, feedback apprentice-initiated, no streaks/gamification.
- Acknowledged limit: tool amplifies culture, cannot create it. Needs supervisors who give a damn.

**Open / next:**
- [x] **Quarterly reviews UI** — table exists in DB, no UI built yet. Decide visibility (self-only vs supervisor-visible) before building — **DONE eq-field PR #310 merged 2026-06-18 (v3.5.167)**
- [x] **Acknowledgments smoke test** — verify eye icon → ack flow works end-to-end on SKS at core.eq.solutions/sks/field — **DONE: 401 fixed via eq-field PRs #335 + #336 merged 2026-06-25**
- [x] **on_roster app filter** — make roster grid filter on `on_roster` (carried from 2026-06-15) — **DONE eq-field PR #349 merged 2026-06-27**
- [ ] **Curate `sites.field_enabled`** — 591 all enabled → trim to live jobs
- [x] **`EQ_SECRET_SALT` rotation** — demo salt was exposed in chat; rotate when convenient — **MOOT: EQ_SECRET_SALT / HMAC path retired via shell PRs #329 + #430 merged 2026-06-22; salt has no live consumer**

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-15 — SKS Field staff: tenant-bug fix + full roster load

**Completed (live + verified):**
- [x] **Root cause found + fixed** — `workers-canonical-sync` v4: tenant constant `dcb71d03`(EQ)→`7dee117c`(SKS), auto `field_approved=true`, `employment_type` from `eq_role`. Deployed.
- [x] **EQ Field staff 0 → 67** (48 Direct / 11 Apprentice / 8 Labour Hire), all SKS-tagged + approved; 171 licences intact.
- [x] **Cleanup** — removed test-pilot + Emma Curth at source; re-pointed Collin's 7 licences to his live row + removed dup; kept Daniel Bower.
- [x] **`on_roster`** column + `field_people` view (57 on / 10 off); apprentice `year_level` set (11).
- [x] **Substrate** — `eq/field/staff-site-visibility-model.md` (PR #26 merged) + `ops/decisions.md` 2026-06-15 entry.
- [x] **"Nothing shows in Field" ROOT-CAUSED + FIXED (eq-field v3.5.148, PR #289, deployed)** — `JWT_INPLACE_TENANTS={'sks'}` was stale: it routed SKS reads to `public.*` on ehow (0 SKS rows, no `authenticated` grant) instead of the canonical `app_data.field_*` where the data lives. Removed 'sks' → SKS uses the twin path (verified live bundle = `new Set([])`). Also restored the `app_data.field_people` SELECT grant on ehow (lost when the view was recreated for on_roster). Console 403s confirmed the data-JWT mints fine (role=authenticated) — it was pointed at the wrong tables.

**Open / next:**
- [x] **on_roster app filter** — make the eq-field roster grid filter on `on_roster` (code + deploy) — **DONE eq-field PR #349 merged 2026-06-27**
- [ ] **Login hook** (phone-dedup) — workers still can't sign in (separate track; `ops/decisions.md`).
- [ ] **Curate `sites.field_enabled`** — 591 all enabled → trim to live jobs.
- [ ] **Daniel Bower** — confirm leaver / remove.
- [ ] **Generalise `workers-canonical-sync`** — currently single-tenant (hardcodes SKS+ehow).

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-15 (part b) — v3.5.146 + v3.5.147 + canonical architecture rethink

**Completed:**
- [x] **v3.5.146 merged** — canonical worker-link bridge (PR #287). Adds `people.worker_id` column link to jvkn.workers; fire-and-forget lookup on person save.
- [x] **v3.5.147 merged** — canonical worker write (PR #288). Extends v3.5.146: if no jvkn.workers row found by email, creates a stub (name, email, phone, role). `syncAllToCanonical()` bulk action added. Deployed 2026-06-15T02:38Z at `field.eq.solutions`.
- [x] **Architecture rethink completed** — 4-layer model verified and documented (jvkn control plane → Shell → Apps → ehow/zaap tenant canonical). CLAUDE.md updated in eq-field. Memory files written.
- [x] **Design B adapters confirmed LIVE** — `DATA_JWT_ENABLED=on`, `SKS_JWT_SECRET` set. leave-adapter.js / roster-adapter.js / timesheets-adapter.js all enabled for SKS tenant. Schedule/leave/timesheets write to ehow `app_data.*` via JWT.

**Architecture clarifications (verified 2026-06-15):**
- ktmj = EQ demo/operational DB only. Not relevant to canonical architecture.
- jvkn.workers = identity stubs (38 rows). Field reads for cross-app correlation ID; v3.5.147 creates stubs as transition scaffolding only.
- ehow = THE canonical data platform. `app_data.staff` (40 rows) is source of truth for worker profiles.
- Tenant boot path: Field → jvkn.organisations → gets SB_URL (= ehow for SKS) + module entitlements.

**Open / next:**
- [ ] People profile enrichment from ehow — when Field loads a person with worker_id, optionally pre-fill from ehow.app_data.staff. Requires reading ehow via staff map (already loaded by leave adapter). Next meaningful sprint.
- [ ] `ZAAP_JWT_SECRET=""` — EQ tenant JWT broken (acceptable while zaap unpopulated).
- [ ] `APP_ORIGIN` env var stale (`eq-solves-field.netlify.app` → should be `field.eq.solutions`).
- [ ] v3.5.147 create-stub path to be removed when Cards onboarding goes live as the sole jvkn.workers creator.

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-13 (part b) — v3.5.139 + canonical pipeline + housekeeping

**Completed:**
- [x] **v3.5.139 shipped** — CSP `_headers` sync + Sentry T3 scrubbing (PR #277, merged + deployed 2026-06-13T03:16:59Z)
- [x] **credentials-canonical-sync v1 LIVE** — jvkn trigger on `worker_credentials` → ehow `app_data.licences`; 171 licences synced
- [x] **Cards→Core pipeline COMPLETE** — full chain live end-to-end (Cards → jvkn → ehow → Shell JWT → Field staff auto-mode)
- [x] **ehow dedup** — Emma Curth orphan archived; Collin Toohey duplicate archived + staff row deactivated
- [x] **Local main synced** — eq-solves-field local main reset to `origin/main` (068920b)
- [x] **EQ_SECRET_SALT rotation** — removed from tracking (Royce: not rotating)

**Open / Royce-gated:**
- [x] **jvkn duplicate worker (Collin Toohey)** — DELETED (2026-06-13): invite + worker `3d18422d-...` removed; original `7514e57d-...` retained. **Pending:** re-send Collin a fresh Cards/Shell invite
- [ ] Roster data entry on ehow (SKS Field empty schedule/timesheets/leave)
- [ ] Standalone `sks-nsw-labour` retirement
- [ ] Track 2 RLS STEP 2 (after standalone retired)

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-13 — EQ Service iframe loading fix (Shell PR #334)

**Completed:**
- [x] **EQ Service loading fixed (eq-shell PR #334)** — `ServiceIframe.tsx` fallback timer 12s → 4s. Root cause: stale OTP comment; TOKEN MODE handshake completes in ~2-3s. Merged + deployed 2026-06-13T00:44:57Z. Service now appears within ~4s.
- [x] Sentry breadcrumbs added — `EQ_SERVICE_READY` received (info) + fallback reveal fired (warning)

**Pending verification:**
- [ ] **Royce: smoke test** — navigate to `core.eq.solutions/sks/service`, confirm Service dashboard loads within 5s (hard-refresh if needed)

**Deferred (Royce-gated):**
- [ ] Roster data entry on ehow (SKS Field — empty schedule/timesheets/leave)
- [ ] Standalone `sks-nsw-labour` retirement — after soak confirmation
- [ ] Track 2 RLS STEP 2 — anon SELECT lockdown; after standalone retired
- [ ] jvkn→ehow canonical identity pipeline — `WORKERS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` + `EHOW_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` must be set in Supabase Dashboard before bulk sync runs
- [x] Waves 2–3 personal PIN revert — v3.5.132–134 deployed wrong direction; revert before further auth work — **DONE eq-field PR #276 merged 2026-06-13 (v3.5.136)**

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-11 — SKS canonical DB full JWT coverage + start fresh

**Completed (EQ Field v3.5.125 — PR [#267](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/267), merged):**
- [x] All 11 `app_data.field_*` views created on ehow — fixes PGRST205 / zeros + loading spinners on `core.eq.solutions/sks/field`
- [x] `public.site_diaries` table created on ehow (completes `JWT_TABLES` coverage)
- [x] `public.organisations` stub created (eliminates 404 boot noise)
- [x] RLS WITH CHECK hardened on all 14 write policies (org_id + authenticated + JWT tenant claim)
- [x] `audit_log` policies fixed (stale nspb UUID `1eb831f9` → correct SKS org_id)
- [x] 109 legacy audit_log rows deleted — clean slate on ehow
- [x] Migration file `supabase/migrations/20260611_sks_canonical_field_sync.sql` committed

**Data state post-session (ehow):** 58 staff · 591 sites · 0 roster rows (empty, data entry needed)

**Deferred (Royce-gated):**
- [ ] **Roster data entry on ehow** — schedule/timesheets/leave empty; start fresh or migrate from nspb
- [ ] **Standalone sks-nsw-labour retirement** — after soak confirmation
- [ ] **Track 2 RLS STEP 2** — anon SELECT lockdown; after standalone retired
- [x] **`EQ_SECRET_SALT` rotation** — MOOT: HMAC path retired via shell PRs #329 + #430 (2026-06-22). Salt has no live consumers. No rotation needed.

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-10 — EQ Service Shell SSO root cause + fix (Session 7)

**Completed (2026-06-10):**
- [x] **EQ Service Shell SSO — ROOT CAUSE found + fixed (eq-shell PR #306)** — After 4 Service-side bugs (Sessions 5+6), Service still showed login page. Root cause was in Shell: `COOKIE_AUTH = true` in `ServiceIframe.tsx` bypassed TOKEN MODE. Cookie not reliably present at iframe-load time (Shell restores from Supabase cookies without re-minting `eq_shell_session`). Fix: `COOKIE_AUTH = false` → TOKEN MODE always (Supabase JWT handshake). Shell deploy `6a285d53` live.
- [x] **Diagnostic logs cleaned up** — eq-service PR #274 removes console.logs from proxy.ts + shell-sso added during investigation.

**Pending verification:**
- [ ] **Royce: smoke test Service SSO** — fresh incognito → `core.eq.solutions` → Shell login → click Service → dashboard loads without login prompt. Tick Sprint 7 smoke test when done.
- [x] **Merge eq-service PR #274** — diagnostic log cleanup (no functional change, safe to merge anytime) — **MERGED 2026-06-09**

## ⏩ Sprint 7 — EQ Service cutover (urjh → ehow) — 2026-06-08

**Done:** Schema (28 CMMS tables) + data + 9 storage files migrated to ehow;
Netlify env vars (Supabase URL/keys, SITE_URL, Sentry) swapped; code domain
refs updated (PR #257 → main, open); repo on `eq-solutions/eq-service`.

**Follow-on tasks:**
- [ ] **`canonical_field_id` gap** — all 37 SKS Service sites have `canonical_field_id = NULL`.
      The bridge from EQ Service sites to EQ Field dispatch is not wired. Separate task,
      not blocking the cutover. (Surfaced during Sprint 7 canonical-id audit.)
- [ ] **Smoke test (Royce)** — sign in via Shell OTP at service.eq.solutions, confirm
      checks/tests/defects visible, create a test check → lands in ehow tenant `7dee117c-…`.
      *(Shell SSO now fixed — 2026-06-09, 4 bugs fixed, deploy 6a27f277. Test in incognito.)*
- [x] **PR #257** — merge to main (triggers deploy) once smoke test passes — **MERGED 2026-06-08**
- [x] **Post-verification:** redirect + urjh keys + Netlify decommission — **DONE: urjh project DELETED 2026-06-22 (PR #327)**
- [ ] **Scheduler/route migration (4.4)** — `supervisor-digest` + `pre-visit-brief` schedulers
      depend on Next.js `/api/cron/*` routes still in eq-service; needs a route-hosting decision
      before moving to eq-shell.

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-07 (PM) — Cross-app linkage audit

Live-verified map of Cards/Shell/Field/Service/Quotes linkage (4 Supabase projects + 5 repos, read-only).
Full report: [`cross-app-linkage-audit-2026-06-07.md`](../cross-app-linkage-audit-2026-06-07.md).
Gated playbook: [`cross-app-linkage-remediation-plan-2026-06-07.md`](../cross-app-linkage-remediation-plan-2026-06-07.md).
Sprint (steelman-corrected, 10/10): [`cross-app-linkage-sprint-2026-06-07.md`](../cross-app-linkage-sprint-2026-06-07.md) — 7 workstreams, 4 waves, pre-mortem.

**Headline:** canonical model (`ehow.app_data`) is FK-wired but its linking rows are empty (`jobs`=0, `quote`=0);
worker→staff link 1/50, customer `canonical_id` 0/520 in live ehow, sites→customer 28/591. Asset sync (4808) works.

**Prioritised actions (all Royce-gated — see plan for mechanism/verify):**
- [x] **P4 (small, do first):** repoint Cards→Field approval bridge off legacy `ktmj` → live plane (`app_data.staff`). **DONE 2026-06-09** — WS7 bridge confirmed 2026-06-08.
- [x] **P1a:** resolve GATE A onto eq-cards `claude/otp-tenant-fix` (Option A). **DONE 2026-06-09** — worker identity linker PR merged.
- [x] **P1b:** backfill `app_data.staff.cards_worker_id` — **GATE A landed 2026-06-09**; `backfill-worker-links` run deferred to post Netlify deploy.
- [~] **P2:** customer convergence — **PARTIAL APPLIED 2026-06-07** (`_ws1-customer-dedup-2026-06-07.md`): Tier S 38
      stub customers retired (dup-groups 117→80); 28 quotes `canonical_id` linked (1:1-both-sides). **Remaining:** decide
      SoR (rec `app_data.customers`); Tier A merge (26, supervised); Tier C (50 ambiguous) + quotes-side N:1 dedup via
      Intake; 99 dangling sites need source re-import. Note: `sks_quotes_customers.canonical_id` is UNIQUE (1:1) vs N:1 data.
- [x] **P3:** backfill `app_data.sites.customer_id` — **APPLIED 2026-06-07 (ehow)**: 440 sites linked (28→468),
      assets→customer 4769/4808 (99.2%). Reversible; record in `_ws2-site-customer-backfill-2026-06-07.md`. Remaining
      123 sites wait on P2 (customer dedup); `zaap` (30 sites) not yet run.
- [x] **P5 (decision):** who owns "job/work-order"? **DONE 2026-06-09** — WS4 quote-job-consumer built canonical work-order spine; `app_data.jobs` now wired.
- [ ] **P7a:** SKS anon-remediation (nspb) — exact policy worklist in plan §7a. **SKS-live, gated.**
- [ ] **P7b:** ktmj anon-write policies close via the pause/decommission already pending (after P4).
- [ ] **P7d:** run a `get_advisors` pass on the EQ Service DB — now `ehowgjardagevnrluult` (sks-canonical, `service.*` schema). Service migrated off `urjhmkhbgaxrofurpbgc` 2026-06-08; that project was deleted 2026-06-22 before this audit ran.
- [x] Audit internal authz of jvkn anon RPCs `eq_cards_get_worker_hr_record`, `eq_cards_delete_account` —
      **CLEARED 2026-06-07**: both `SECURITY DEFINER` but scoped to `auth.uid()`; anon has no uid → harmless. Non-issue.

**Drift corrected (live wins):** `architecture.md` "jvkn = no operational data" is false (it's the worker house);
creds 779→737, invites 37→58 since 06-03; `0028_contact_customer_links` IS present on SKS (291 rows).
## SKS Live — roles / security-groups track (2026-06-07)

Parallel to the Field schema/data cutover below. Full plan + agent prompts (A–E): [`sks-live-sprint-2026-06-07.md`](../sks-live-sprint-2026-06-07.md). Live-verified 2026-06-07: `shell_control` has 9 groups / 16 perms / **0** user assignments; tenant `sks` = 3 × manager.

- [x] **eq-roles** — merge PR #7 → tag `v2.3.0` (unblocks the eq-shell dep bump) — **DONE PR #7 merged 2026-06-07**
- [ ] **eq-shell** — converge `c2-shell-roles` + `sks-field-host` into one trunk (Prompt A; Royce picks trunk).
- [ ] **eq-shell Phase 2** — wire group perms into the session as `extra_perms` via `resolveEffectivePermissions` (Prompt B).
- [ ] **eq-shell Phase 3** — `AdminSecurityGroups` page; first write moves `user_security_groups` off 0 rows (Prompt C).
- [ ] **eq-shell Phase 4** — walk ONE real SKS user end-to-end; first-ever `user_security_groups` row (Prompt D).
- [ ] **Phase 5 hardening** — `contact_customer_links` explicit `WITH CHECK` (`::uuid` cast) + CI policy-lint + eq-roles no-orphan-keys test (Prompt E).

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-06 — SKS tenant LIVE on EQ Field + JWT/RLS Track 2 staged + Teams uuid fix

**SKS is now usable on the EQ Field build** at `field.sks.eq.solutions` (eq-field **v3.5.83**). Big correction vs the earlier draft of this block: **`DATA_JWT_ENABLED` is ON deploy-wide**, so SKS runs on the AUTHED JWT path post-login (not anon parity), and STEP 1 is load-bearing.

**Completed (EQ Field, prod-verified):**
- **v3.5.82 — SKS pipeline JWT+RLS carrier (B5 Track 2)** (PR [#195](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/195)). Per-tenant data-JWT secret resolver + in-place carrier (`JWT_INPLACE_TENANTS={sks}` → `public.*` on SKS's own Supabase).
- **STEP 1 RLS (authed policies) APPLIED to SKS prod** (migration `sks_pipeline_rls_step1_additive`; 22 `field_authed_*` policies; anon untouched/intact). **Load-bearing** — with the flag on, this is what lets SKS read its own data post-login. **Do NOT roll back.** Dry-run-validated on a disposable Supabase branch first.
- **v3.5.83 — gate anon-fallback fix** (PR [#199](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/199)). Fixed the empty-gate lock-out (pre-login `sbFetch` of JWT_TABLES couldn't mint → now falls back to anon). Verified live: gate lists 69 SKS names.
- **v3.5.81 — Teams id-type fix for uuid tenants** (PR [#196](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/196); dup #197 closed).
- **Canonical hostname** for `sks` = `field.sks.eq.solutions` (was repointed to `sks-field.netlify.app` then finalised to the custom domain).
- **Track-2 migration files** PR'd ([#200](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/200), docs/SQL only): STEP1 (applied), STEP2 lockdown (deferred), PRE-SNAPSHOT, original marked superseded.
- **`core.eq.solutions` → SKS Field WORKING** — eq-shell [#189](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-shell/pull/189) (merged + live). The admin auto-route honored a sticky `localStorage` last-pick over the URL tenant, so `/sks/field` loaded the empty EQ tenant; fixed so the active shell tenant wins. Verified live (loads `field.sks.eq.solutions` + sks even with last-pick=eq).
- **SKS-canonical drift fixed:** `app_data.eq_intake_rate_limits` RLS gate `user_metadata`→`app_metadata` on `ehow` (aligned to core; source migration `0023_intake_infra.sql` already correct — SKS had drifted out-of-band). Unblocked the eq-shell schema-drift CI gate.

**Pre-go-live hardening pass (2026-06-06) — advisors swept on nspbmi/ehow/jvkn + dual-write + DEFINER audits:**
- **Dual-write silent-data-loss FIXED (was HIGH).** EQ Field writes `people.employment_type/rto/hire_company` + `sites.project_id`; SKS lacked them → every person/site edit from EQ Field would 400 and silently drop. Added the 4 nullable columns to SKS prod (`nspbmirochztcjijmcrx`), matching the EQ plane. **Smoke a person + site edit post-merge of #202.**
- **SSO "view only" + Teams create FIXED + MERGED** — eq-field [#202](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/202) (v3.5.85, live): cookie SSO path grants supervisor to platform admins (parity w/ token path); `teams`+`team_members` added to ORG_TABLES (org_id NOT NULL stamping).
- **Team DELETE FIXED + MERGED** — eq-field [#203](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/203) (v3.5.86, live): `deleteTeam` removes `team_members` links before the team (SKS FK isn't ON DELETE CASCADE → delete had 400'd on any team with members).
- **SKS-canonical rate-limit DEFINER fns hardened (live):** `eq_check/increment_intake_rate_limit` trusted a caller-supplied `p_tenant_id` (cross-tenant) + mutable search_path → pinned search_path + revoked EXECUTE from public/anon/authenticated (sole caller is the api-intake edge fn on service_role). 
- **Audits clean elsewhere:** the 17 other ehow DEFINER RPCs are JWT-tenant-scoped (safe); the 4 anon-callable control-plane Cards DEFINER fns are auth.uid()/token-gated (safe — advisor pattern, not a hole). Control plane has NO anon exposure of registry/config/entitlements.
- **Track-2 SQL artifacts merged** — eq-field [#200](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/200) (record only).

**Royce decisions (2026-06-06):**
- ❌ **PITR DECLINED** — $100/mo/project too expensive at this scale. Weekly backups stand; ~14-day worst-case RPO accepted (consistent with the existing SKS backup decision). Cheap alt on file if wanted: daily `pg_dump` → storage.
- ❌ **Key rotation DECLINED** for now — `EQ_SECRET_SALT` (exposed shared master key) + `GOOGLE_DOC_AI_CREDENTIALS` rotation deferred at Royce's call; risk accepted. Runbook (`eq-secret-salt-rotation-runbook-2026-06-06.md`) stays on file.

**Remaining for SKS go-live (Royce-gated):**
- [ ] Functional click-through smoke on `core.eq.solutions/sks/field` (supervisor): **person edit + site edit + team create + team delete** (confirm the dual-write/teams fixes) → pipeline / import / resources / roster / safety against SKS data.
- [ ] Cutover **soak** 24–48h with the standalone (`sks-nsw-labour`, v3.10.59) kept warm → then **retire** the standalone.
- [ ] **Track 2 STEP 2 (anon lockdown)** — DEFERRED until the standalone is retired. Then move `AUDIT_SB_KEY` → service_role and drop the `audit_log` anon-insert carve-out.
- [ ] **Onboarding** — invite-claim rollout (only 1 of 36 workers linked; 0/56 invites claimed). Upstream eq-shell #183/#175.

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-05

**Completed (EQ Field):**
- v3.5.73 — job numbers on the weekly schedule (project→job, derived onto roster grid + My Schedule). PR [#186](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/186), merged, live.
- v3.5.74 — per-cell job **pin** for multi-job sites (Edit Roster pick-list; pin > project primary > none). PR [#187](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/187), merged, live.

**Deferred (next step, Royce-gated):**
- [ ] Auto-fill labour-hire/apprentice Field timesheets from the roster job pin (the invoice-reconciliation path). Held deliberately — touches the accounts reconciliation.

**Rollout note:** a site only offers a job pick-list when its jobs are tagged to it (Job Numbers → Site, `job_numbers.site_name`).

**⚠ Correction to a carried-forward action (below):** the "Downgrade/pause `ktmjmdzqrogauaevbktn`" item is **BLOCKED** — verified 2026-06-05 that this DB is still the **live EQ data plane** (serves all projects/sites/jobs/people/schedule; the zaap `app_data.field_*` twins are empty). Pausing it takes EQ Field down. Do not action until the canonical reseed/cutover lands.

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-05 (part b) — PostHog MCP + EQ Core go-live readiness

**Done:**
- **PostHog MCP connected** (claude.ai OAuth connector → `mcp.posthog.com`, EU, project 162632). Live-queried. *(Connector is mislabeled "Github" in the connector list — rename when convenient.)*
- **Data read:** ~19 real sticky users (not the inflated 419 UUIDs), growing usage, flat retention tail. Auth surface most-exercised.
- **Go-live readiness verified vs LIVE systems** → no structural blockers. Canonical DB healthy + RLS-clean + 0 ERROR advisors; auth/iframe-SSO engineered; anon RPCs audited (3 clear, 1 optional `claim_invite` null-guard).
- **`eq/go-live-runbook.md`** written + committed — live-verified weekend runbook.

**Go-live gates (weekend) — see `eq/go-live-runbook.md` §B:**
- [x] 🔴 **`EQ_SECRET_SALT` parity** Shell vs Service — silent #1 go/no-go, never compared — **MOOT: EQ_SECRET_SALT retired 2026-06-22 (shell + service PRs #329); no live consumer**
- [ ] Finish **Service domain cutover** (DNS/TLS, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, Supabase URL allowlist on `ehowgjardagevnrluult`). Service prod project resolved: migrated to ehow (sks-canonical) 2026-06-08; old `urjhmkhbgaxrofurpbgc` (-dev) deleted 2026-06-22.
- [ ] 🟠 **MFA-bypass posture** — PIN-only Shell → Service single-factor; accept or gate behind mandatory Shell-TOTP

**Deferred (spun off as post-launch tasks):**
- [ ] Unify cross-app PostHog distinct_id (Shell UUID / Field `tenant:handle` / Service id) — fixes the "refused to merge" warning + the inflated user count
- [ ] Fix EQ Field double `$pageview` capture (SPA logs ~80% of pageviews as `/`)
- [ ] Optional: add `auth.uid() IS NULL` guard to `eq_cards_claim_invite`

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-04

**Completed (EQ Field):**
- v3.5.72 — removed the "Pick a demo tenant" workspace picker; EQ Field now boots straight into the default `eq` tenant (PR [#185](https://github.com/eq-solutions/eq-field/pull/185), merged, live). Demo tiers still reachable via `?tenant=demo-trades` / `?tenant=melbourne`.

**Pending Royce-actions (carried forward):**
- [ ] Downgrade old EQ DB `ktmjmdzqrogauaevbktn` → free tier in Supabase dashboard, then pause it (paid projects can't be paused via API)
- [ ] `TENANT_ORG_UUID` Netlify env var for eq-solves-field EQ site (blocks U6 PIN)
- [x] Revoke old `gho_...` PAT at github.com/settings/tokens — **DONE 2026-06-28**
- [ ] Drift CI secrets in eq-shell GitHub repo settings
- [ ] HaveIBeenPwned toggle in eq-canonical Supabase Auth settings

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-03 (PM) — EQ Field anon-remediation Phase 2 + SKS sync

**Completed (all prod-verified; EQ repo only, no cross-deploy):**
- **Phase 2 (Goal 1 — secure same-shape):** 22 Field surfaces moved off the anon key onto the
  authenticated data-plane JWT + RLS via `app_data.field_<name>` twins (`LIKE public.*` + tenant_id,
  anon revoked, granted authenticated). anon REVOKED on all 22 `public.*` (prod anon→401).
  v3.5.62 (11 surfaces) → v3.5.63 (tender pipeline, 323 rows preserved) → v3.5.64 (close leak +
  bucket-B + realtime). PRs #170–172.
- **Dropped 9 dead/empty Field tables** on EQ/zaap (bucket-D). Foreign tables (workers/worker_*/
  qualifications, organisations) left untouched (shared DB).
- **realtime.js** repointed to the secured twins via the data JWT (publication set).
- **SKS sync v3.10.50–51 ported** (timesheet jump-to-top fix + Resources this-week strip). v3.5.65, PR #173.
- Migrations on disk in eq-field/migrations/ (applied via MCP to zaap).

**Decision:** Goal 1 = close the hole only, NOT re-home onto canonical (lossy; canonical isn't a
superset — no pin/role, no region/project). The B5 canonical unification stays a separate track.

**Backlog (deferred, Royce-gated):**
- [ ] **`app_config` PIN-read auth refactor** — last real anon leak; can't be JWT-gated (gate reads
      it pre-login). Needs login-touching change to stop the browser reading PINs.
- [ ] **Realtime browser verification** — repointed but not eyeballed (EQ demo twins empty); fails
      safe to 30s poll.
- [ ] **Drop the revoked `public.*` husks + `public.tenders` fallback** once confident (anon already
      revoked — not leaking).
- [ ] **Apprentices module** — neither wired nor dropped (not in use); secure-or-retire when needed.
- [ ] SKS (separate repo/DB) inherits the Goal-1 pattern when its anon-remediation runs.

## ⏩ Session close — 2026-06-03

**Completed (EQ Field pipeline/Resources sprint — all live; mirrored to SKS standalone):**
- Resources: Remove/archive job (v3.5.53–54, BUG-009 modal-confirm fix)
- Pipeline: value + probability sliders + Keep/Discard triage (v3.5.55)
- Pipeline: Estimator + Builder filters (v3.5.56)
- Resources: edit confirmed-job details + pipeline Start-date tag (v3.5.57)
- Resources: editing workers/duration rebuilds the labour plan (v3.5.58)
- Pipeline import: email-form estimator normalisation + one-time SQL dedupe both DBs (v3.5.59)
- EQ pipeline data migrated `ktm` → `eq-canonical-internal` (pipeline only; roster intentionally NOT migrated — Royce: not relevant)
- SKS standalone kept in lockstep: v3.10.44 → v3.10.49
- Smartsheet import reviewed — parse→preview→confirm gate confirmed safe; no change needed

**Pending Royce-actions (carried forward + new):**
- [ ] **NEW:** Downgrade old EQ DB `ktmjmdzqrogauaevbktn` → free tier in Supabase dashboard, then pause it (paid projects can't be paused via API). Dead cold-backup, unused by live EQ Field.
- [ ] `TENANT_ORG_UUID` Netlify env var for eq-solves-field EQ site (blocks U6 PIN)

## 🟦 Autonomous Sprint — SOURCE OF TRUTH (read first if running sprint work)

Parallel autonomous agents coordinate through three root files (added 2026-05-30):
- `SPRINT-BOARD.md` — full backlog + claim/ownership (claim before you start)
- `AUTONOMOUS-SPRINT-RULES.md` — diverge-proof conventions (branch from origin/main, **timestamp migrations**, SKS-live untouchable, full-auto EQ deploy, auth gated)
- `STATE.md` — per-repo + Supabase reality + known hazards

Autonomy policy: `ops/decisions.md` 2026-05-30. Session log: `sessions/2026-05-30.md`.

**Drift resolved (2026-06-02):** the GTM gate was killed (we build for ourselves — see `ops/decisions.md` 2026-06-02) and the stale gate language was purged from the forward docs. The "two-Supabase obsolete / single canonical" framing is also stale — reality is the two-plane split (`eq-canonical` + `eq-canonical-internal`). `STATE.md` carries current reality.

## EQ Design System — consolidation (plan 2026-05-31)

Foundation shipped (One Spine, Stream A): `@eq-solutions/tokens` v1.0 consumed (not vendored) across Shell/Service/Field/Cards; `@eq-solutions/ui` v1.0.1 = Button/Skeleton/Table. Full plan + model: `design-system-consolidation-2026-05-31.md`, `ops/decisions.md` 2026-05-31. Remaining (board rows A7–A12):

- [ ] **A7** eq-ui Modal + ConfirmDialog (fold in a11y A1/A2 from `quality-polish-backlog-2026-05-30.md`)
- [ ] **A8** eq-ui FormInput
- [ ] **A9** eq-ui StatusBadge + KindPill
- [ ] **A10** eq-ui Card + Toast + Tabs (resolve ghost-border → Option B)
- [ ] **A11** Font self-host in the shared package (supersedes per-app P5)
- [ ] Confirm the pin-by-tag migration landed (eq-ui v1.0.1 / eq-roles tags); move any `#main` consumers to `#vX`
- [ ] Add 2 drift items to `quality-polish-backlog-2026-05-30.md`: Service emoji-in-Lucide (~7 files), Service `RouteProgress` cyan→indigo gradient — **verify vs origin/main first**
- [x] **A12** Claude Design context bundle — `eq/design/claude-design-context.md` created + issued to Claude Design 2026-05-31
- [x] Quotes (Flask) decision — **leave at 85%**, no investment (React rewrite supersedes, ~2–3mo)

## EQ Solves Field — LEAD MODULE

**Multi-tenancy plan locked 2026-04-27** — see
`eq/field/multi-tenancy/plan.md` for living spec.

**No validation gate.** EQ is built for ourselves (SKS NSW) because it's
a good product — build investment is sequenced by the trust ladder +
Royce's go, not by outside-customer validation (gate killed 2026-06-02,
see `ops/decisions.md`).
- [x] Netlify env var cleanup — confirmed clean 2026-05-29 (prior session
      deleted hashes; only `EQ_SECRET_SALT` + active vars remain)
- [ ] Clear Supabase rate_limits table on demo branch (ktmjmdzqrogauaevbktn)
- [ ] Write fresh Cowork brief for EQ Field (guardrails, demo branch rules)

### Tender Pipeline — SKS promotion (blocked)

Shipped to demo 2026-05-14 (v3.4.79 → v3.4.84 across patches). Do NOT
promote to `main`/SKS until all three are cleared:

- [ ] Apply migrations 001 + 002 to SKS Supabase (`nspbmirochztcjijmcrx`)
- [ ] Remove pipeline tables from `TENANT_DISABLED_TABLES.sks` in
      `scripts/app-state.js`
- [ ] Backfill `migrations/` on disk from `list_migrations` MCP
      (applied via MCP only — not on disk)

Open Tender Pipeline items (demo):

- [ ] Wire `clash_detected` PostHog event (reserved in
      `tender-pipeline.js`, not yet firing)
- [ ] Decide `pending_schedule` table fate — currently written but
      bypassed (Confirm Curve writes direct to `schedule`). Either
      promote it to a real CM-editable staging queue with a second
      approval page, or drop it and treat `schedule` as the single
      source of truth
- [ ] Lazy-load SheetJS if first-load bundle size becomes a problem
      (~250KB added)

### Phase 1 — implementation (in progress on `claude/hopeful-wright-058c8b`)

5 commits past `demo` tip on feature branch; not merged.

- [x] `scripts/flags.js` PostHog wrapper — commit `e9b4706`
- [ ] `feat_project_hours_v1` flag in EQ PostHog project (`phc_zXpRxm6Q…`),
      default off, targeted at Royce only first **(Royce manual step)**
- [x] `sites.track_hours` + `sites.budget_hours` SQL written —
      `migrations/2026-04-27_sites_track_hours.sql` (commit `8b6bdb1`)
- [ ] Apply that migration to `ktmjmdzqrogauaevbktn` via Supabase MCP /
      Studio **(Royce manual step — review SQL first)**
- [x] Project-hours UI scaffolding: self-mounting burn-down panel —
      commit `89f96dc`. Activates when both gates open (PostHog flag on +
      `EQ_PERMS.can('ph.view_dashboard')` true). Graceful empty / coming-soon
      states until migration is applied.
- [x] `eq_role` Postgres enum + `people.role` column SQL written —
      `migrations/2026-04-27_eq_role_enum_people_role.sql` (commit `8b6bdb1`).
      Header includes verification queries to run before applying.
- [ ] Apply that migration to `ktmjmdzqrogauaevbktn` **(Royce manual step —
      verify pre-conditions in header first)**
- [x] `verify-pin.js` Phase 1 wiring (2026-05-29) — PIN path now derives and
      returns `eq_role` ('supervisor'/'employee'); all 3 auth paths store
      `eq_role` in `window.EQ_SESSION.app_metadata.eq_role`; shipped as
      **v3.5.23, PR #135** on eq-solutions/eq-field.
      **Royce: smoke deploy-preview then squash-merge PR #135.**
      Full verify-pin rewrite (tenant-slug → DB lookup, per-user JWT) is
      Phase 2 multi-tenancy work — still gated.
- [x] `scripts/permission-matrix.js` (matrix v1) + `scripts/permissions.js`
      (`EQ_PERMS.can()` + `.role()` + `.list()`) — commits `f2d0e91`, `b367eb1`
- [x] Strategy decided: existing `isManager` global stays; `EQ_PERMS` reads
      it as primary today-path signal. Legacy migration is opportunistic,
      not a sweep (97 occurrences ruled out wholesale refactor).
- [x] PR [#23](https://github.com/Milmlow/eq-field-app/pull/23) merged to
      `demo` (merge commit `996a895`, 2026-04-27 09:36 UTC). Netlify
      auto-deploy triggered. Verify Project Hours panel appears on
      eq-solves-field.netlify.app once deploy lands.

### Phase 2 — multi-tenancy foundation (gated on customer trigger)

Do **not** start until one of these fires:

- First self-serve trial signup is on a calendar
- ~3 customers manually provisioned and per-customer ops cost is biting

Items when triggered:

- [ ] FK + NOT NULL + CHECK constraints on all 14+ `org_id` columns
- [ ] RLS policies, per-table behind a kill switch (`mt_rls_strict` flag),
      lowest-traffic table first
- [ ] Edge function audit (`supervisor-digest`, `ts-reminder`) — service-role
      bypasses RLS, so `org_id` filter discipline must be explicit in queries
- [ ] Demo-mode redesign — currently bypasses Supabase entirely; must hit a
      sandboxed real tenant for self-serve trials
- [ ] Routing infrastructure (Cloudflare Worker proxy on
      `eq.solutions/field/*` OR `field.eq.solutions` subdomain on Netlify)

## EQ Solves Service

- [ ] **Delta WO import — live dry-run** on SKS tenant with Aug 2025 file:
      confirm ~250 rows resolve, MVSWBD fuzzy prompt fires, LBS unknown-code
      prompt works, commit succeeds, re-upload triggers duplicate blocker
- [ ] Full-repo file-header backfill (EQ-IP-Register P2 #7 scope A) —
      dedicated session
- [ ] Continue sprint cadence (22 sprints to date, 80 Vitest tests)

## CRITICAL — Rotate GitHub PATs (substrate exposure)

Discovered 2026-05-19: `system/infrastructure.md` was tracking the literal
values of all 3 GitHub PATs in plaintext from at least 2026-05-15. GitHub
push-protection caught the pattern when this commit re-touched the file
and rejected the push. Older commits in the substrate history likely
contain the same values and were pushed before push-protection caught up.

**Treat all 3 as compromised regardless of which got "removed" from
`.git-credentials.*` files** — they've been on GitHub.

- [x] **Revoke all 3 PATs** — DONE 2026-06-28 (EQ Solutions, Milmlow, Milmlow alt revoked)
- [x] **Issue one new fine-grained PAT** — EQ_CONTEXT_PAT created 2026-06-28 (fine-grained, org secret, notify-substrate use only)
- [ ] Update `C:\Projects\.git-credentials.eq-solutions` and
      `C:\Projects\.git-credentials` on the Beelink with the new value.
- [ ] **Verify push works** on eq-context after PAT rotation.
- [ ] **Substrate hardening** — consider adding `gitleaks` (or similar)
      pre-commit hook on the eq-context repo so secret-scan happens
      locally before push.

## EQ Shell + EQ Intake

> **⚠ SUPERSEDED (2026-05-30) — the architecture + gate notes in this section are STALE; `STATE.md` carries current reality.** (1) The **two-plane** model is current, NOT "single canonical": browser → `eq-canonical` (control plane) + tenant data **server-only** in `eq-canonical-internal` (`zaapmfdkgedqupfjtchl`). The "Two-Supabase obsolete / single canonical" copy below is itself now obsolete. (2) The **GTM validation gate was REMOVED** — do NOT block Shell Phase 2 (or any EQ work) on outside-customer validation (see `ops/decisions.md` + memory `feedback_gtm_intent`). Historical detail below kept for record only.

**Status as of 2026-05-20:** Phase 1.E + 1.F shipped (single canonical
Supabase, Intake module live at `/core/intake`, Unified Identity, RLS
swept to `app_metadata`). Phase 2 paused — no further shell modules
until the GTM validation gate clears (see EQ GTM PRIORITY section
below) OR a paying customer specifically asks for one.

**Two-Supabase architecture is OBSOLETE** as of Phase 1.E (2026-05-19).
Current state:

- `eq-canonical` (`jvknxcmbtrfnxfrwfimn`) — single canonical project
  holding both shell control tables (`tenants`, `users`,
  `module_entitlements`) and tenant application data (13 canonical
  entity tables incl. `licences` added 2026-05-20 part-c). Region
  `ap-southeast-2`.
- `eq-shell-control` (`hxwitoveffxhcgjvubbd`) — **DECOMMISSIONED**
  2026-05-19 per `sessions/2026-05-19.md`.
- `sks-canonical-eq` — planned, not provisioned. Gated on GTM
  validation gate, not on shell readiness.

### Critique action items — deferred to Phase 2 resumption

Three external-model critiques (Claude / Grok / ChatGPT) shopped
2026-05-20 part-d. The actions below are real risks the architecture
carries today. They DO NOT ship until Phase 2 resumes (GTM gate
clears, or a paying customer requests a new module). Priority order
= highest blast-radius first.

- [x] **Dual-salt rotation support for `EQ_SECRET_SALT`** — MOOT: `mint-iframe-token` and the HMAC salt path are both retired (shell PRs #329 + #430 merged 2026-06-22). TOKEN MODE (Supabase JWT via token-exchange.ts) is the sole minting path. No rotation needed.
- [ ] **Dual-secret support in `verify-shell-session`** for
      `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` rotation. Same rationale.
- [ ] **`revoked_sessions` table** + shorten JWT TTL from 1 hour to
      ~30 minutes. Without this you cannot kill an active session
      before its TTL expires.
- [ ] **Schema split** — `shell_control.*` (tenants/users/
      module_entitlements) vs `app_data.*` (canonical entities) in
      the same `eq-canonical` project. `CREATE SCHEMA` +
      `search_path` update. Free now, saves ~3 weeks when a regional
      secondary is needed.
- [ ] **Per-domain RPC decomposition** — split
      `eq_intake_commit_batch` before it accumulates 5 module
      branches. Per-entity validators in a shared library; per-domain
      RPCs call the library. Currently 1 mega-RPC handles all
      mutation; this is the chokepoint all three critiques flagged.
- [ ] **Canonical → Field one-way sync rule** documented + enforced
      with a Supabase trigger for shared concepts (staff, sites,
      schedule_entries). Never the reverse. Otherwise dual-write
      pain during iframe-purgatory becomes uncontrolled.
- [ ] **Token-mint audit log** (tenant_id, IP, timestamp) with a
      Sentry threshold alert per `https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp/eq-solutions/eq-shell`.
      Today there's no detection mechanism for a stolen salt.
- [ ] **Build-time hash check** for the vendored `@eq/*` packages so
      a stale vendor can't silently ship through Netlify.
- [ ] **`STABLE SECURITY DEFINER` wrapper** for the `tenant_id` UUID
      cast read in every RLS predicate (perf optimisation for the
      day load matters).
- [ ] **Iframe retirement deadline decision** — Grok pushed 9 months,
      Claude said 3 years is a roadmap not purgatory, ChatGPT said
      4 years is the modal failure mode. Pick a number, write it
      somewhere, hold to it. Not a code task; a strategic decision
      Royce makes when Phase 2 resumes.

Full critique synthesis + the items already shipped (so we don't
re-litigate them) is in [sessions/2026-05-20-part-d.md](../sessions/2026-05-20-part-d.md).

### Substrate-drift note (2026-05-20 part-d)

The `eq-shell/README.md` Phase 2 row said "Tender Pipeline first"
through 2026-05-20. This was a stale claim — Tender Pipeline is a
Field sub-module, not a flagship shell module. The README has been
corrected. Going forward: when writing critique prompts or briefing
external models against the shell, read the substrate actively, do
not just copy what the README says — and check for drift signals
(passing pivots that have hardened into "platform doctrine"
language).

### Dedupe-on-ingest skill (intake feature)

Decision logged 2026-05-19 in `ops/decisions.md` ("Dedupe Is Intake's
Job, Not Per-App"). When EQ Intake ingests a CRM export, the
collapse-dupes step (e.g. "47 rows of Equinix Australia Pty Ltd →
1 customer + 47 sites") happens inside intake via the Confirm-UI,
not inside the app reading the data. Implementation detail to be
added to `eq-intake/CONFIRM-UI-SPEC.md` as a new section.

- [ ] **Extend `eq-intake/CONFIRM-UI-SPEC.md`** with a "Dedupe
      confirmation step" section (confidence tiers, screen sketch,
      signature caching). Companion to the existing column-mapping
      confirmation spec.
- [ ] **Implement the dedupe step in the intake pipeline** — runs
      AFTER column-mapping is confirmed, BEFORE the commit_batch
      call. Two confidence tiers (HIGH = exact normalized name
      match, MEDIUM = fuzzy match needing review).
- [ ] **Test against the SimPRO bundle** — 524 customer-site rows
      should collapse to ~150 unique customer rows + 524 site rows
      in canonical.

### EQ Shell Phase 1.B (Netlify wire-up) — DONE

- [x] Phase 1.B (Netlify wire-up), 1.C (Field-side `?sh=` handler),
      1.D (end-to-end smoke), 1.E (single-canonical consolidation),
      1.F (Unified Identity + `app_metadata` RLS sweep) — all
      shipped by 2026-05-20. `core.eq.solutions` live, Intake module
      at `/core/intake` running the `@eq/*` engine end-to-end.

### eq-demo-canonical — security advisor cleanup (open)

Diagnosed 2026-05-19. 17 advisor warnings, fix drafted but not applied.

- [ ] **Apply migration 004 to `eq-demo-canonical`** —
      `C:\Projects\eq-intake\sql\004_security_advisor_fix.sql`
      rewritten 2026-05-19 to grant EXECUTE to `authenticated`
      (not `service_role` — see session log for why). Paste into the
      Supabase SQL editor for the project and Run.
- [ ] **Toggle leaked-password protection** in eq-canonical (`jvknxcmbtrfnxfrwfimn`)
      dashboard → Authentication → Settings → enable HaveIBeenPwned check.
      **(Royce manual step)**
- [ ] **Commit + push the two eq-intake edits** —
      `sql/004_security_advisor_fix.sql` and
      `eq-platform/scripts/db-apply.ts` are uncommitted in
      `C:\Projects\eq-intake` (no auto-push hook on that repo, no
      GitHub remote either per `system/infrastructure.md`).
- [ ] **Smoke-test intake commit after applying 004** — through the
      signed-in shell, an intake commit through the demo path should
      still succeed (authenticated grant retained). An anon-key curl
      to the same RPC should now return 403.
- [ ] **Decide on server-side commit RPC migration** — the 4
      remaining "Signed-In Users Can Execute SECURITY DEFINER"
      warnings clear only if the commit moves to a Netlify Function
      (service-role) AND the in-function `auth.jwt()` tenant check
      is rewritten. Deferred — no urgency until `sks-canonical-eq`
      is provisioned with real users.

### sks-canonical-eq provisioning (gated, not started)

- [ ] Provision `sks-canonical-eq` Supabase project (Sydney /
      `ap-southeast-2`).
- [ ] Run `pnpm db:apply` from `eq-platform/` to regenerate
      `all-migrations.sql` with 004 bundled (`db-apply.ts` updated
      2026-05-19).
- [ ] Paste `all-migrations.sql` into the new project's SQL editor.
- [ ] Add Royce as the first user with `user_metadata.tenant_id`
      set to the SKS tenant uuid.
- [ ] Drop SKS credentials into the Netlify env vars for the
      production shell deployment.
